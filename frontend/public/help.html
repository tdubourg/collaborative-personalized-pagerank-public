<h2 id="tldr">TL; DR</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>This user study is for you to select &#8220;top 5 most relevant&#8221; (per column/ranking list) results, <strong>in accordance to a
given context</strong> among two presented rankings and also <strong>which ranking is the best, overall</strong> (left/right).</p></li>
<li><p>You can select between 0 and 5 results (<strong>per column</strong>!). You do not necessarily need to select 5. If you want to
select more than 5, keep the best (in your opinion) 5 ones.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There are only 5 queries, so do not hesitate to clicks on links (blue titles / green urls) and make sure about what you
think is best.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A &#8220;Help&#8221; button will be on the left</strong>, to bring back this modal window in case you need.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Left/Right rankings are randomly swapped</strong> at every page reload, so that you cannot be biased by a left/right
preference. Do not make assumptions about wheter the left or right side is better, it is going to change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>This is not Google</strong>: Results might seem a little bit &#8220;crap&#8221; sometimes in comparison with Google. Those queries were
matched against a focused/small crawl of the WWW and this is not Google, the results are as good as the web repository
can be.</p></li>

<h2 id="normalversion">Normal Version</h2>

<p>Welcome to the CPPR User Study.</p>

<p>The goal of this study is to provide a user-based relevance measurement to
a pre-selected set of rankings.</p>

<p>Based on the results of the user study, I will be able to make conclusion on
the performance of the algorithm that I have been developing during my Master
Thesis: Collaborative(ly) Personalized PageRank.</p>

<h2 id="howtheuserstudyworks">How The User Study Works</h2>

<p>During the user study, every &#8220;user&#8221; will be presented with the same sequence
of rankings. These rankings have a <em>context</em>. This context is basically clicks/navigation
of users similar to the &#8220;current user&#8221; (similar = similar user profile). These are used
in an attempt to re-rank the SERP (Search Engine Result Page) results to be more tailored
to the &#8220;current user&#8221; profile, using information from similar users.</p>

<p><strong>Your mission, if you accept it, is to imagine you are this user</strong>, the context is often quite
short: Only a couple of links are taken into account (due to several layers of intersections),
simply try to imagine, if you had clicked on such links, what would you be looking for.</p>

<p>Based on this, you can then <strong>select at most 5 results (per column!)</strong> that are <em>relevant</em>. There can be less
than 5, but not more than 5 (the UI won&#8217;t allow more than 5 selected results).</p>

<p>If you really think none of the results are relevant, you can select none of them, a confirmation
will however be asked, to be sure you did not just forget to select them.</p>

<p>Amongst those two rankings, one of them is using the &#8220;standard&#8221; PageRank algorithm.
The other one has been computed using personalized weights extracted based on the context
of users similars to him/her.</p>

<p>You will not know which ranking is personalized or not (although you might guess).
<strong>And the rankings will randomly be swapped sides for every query that you see</strong>. So, please
<strong>do not make any assumptions on whether one side is better than the other one</strong> because they
<em>are randomly swapped</em>.</p>

<h2 id="whatisarelevancyjudgment">What Is A <em>Relevancy Judgment</em></h2>

<p>A relevancy judgment is just: You consider that this result (a link/snippet) is
relevant to the query that is being presented and with the current context (the context is important).</p>

<h2 id="howdoyouprovideyourjudgments">How Do You Provide Your Judgments?</h2>

<p>You simply have to left-click a result to mark it as relevant. It will turn green.
If you misclicked, simply click again on the same result to toggle its relevant/irrelevant state.</p>

<p><strong>You can select between 0 and 5 relevant results</strong> (per column!). If more than 5 results are relevant in your opinion,
select the 5 most relevant ones for left/right columns. If less than 5 results are relevant in your opinion, just select
the ones you think are relevant and validate as is.</p>

<h2 id="globalopiniononbestrankingoverall">Global Opinion On Best Ranking &#8220;Overall&#8221;</h2>

<p>The last thing that will be asked to you is to provide, for every query/context, your overall
preference towards one ranking or the other.</p>

<p><strong>This time, you have to choose, you cannot select both</strong>. Simply select the one
that in your opinion globally answers the best the query / context. Rankings should never
be exactly similar so you should not have to make non-sense choices.</p>

then please contact me (see at the bottom) but that should not be needed.</p>
