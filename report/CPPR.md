This Master Thesis proposes a new technique to improve web search results by personalization. Indeed, we exploit the
history of clicks and search queries as a support to personalize the computation of the PageRank score, which is then
used during the final ranking of the web pages on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP). The objective is to study
whether incorporating such usage-based information using collaborative filtering techniques and using PageRank
personalization provide an improvement or not. According to the study of previous works in terms of web search
personalization, recommender systems and PageRank computation, including PageRank personalization, no such works have
been published previously. As a consequence, we contribute to the field here by providing a detailed, reproducible and
rigorous study of how this technique can be implemented and how well it can work in the case of our implementation.
Throughout our study, we will first review previous related works on topics such as context-aware systems, user
modeling,  recommender systems, web search personalization and the use of PageRank in personalized web search. Second, we
will describe the new system we propose here to take advantage of usage data and integrate it into web search ranking
via  Personalized PageRank. Finally, we will describe the experimental setup we used to implement and evaluate such a
system and the results we obtained. After analyzing such results and comparing them, when possible, to previous works'
results, we will then provide a brief conclusion about the proposed system and its application and also point to future
work that can be done on this topic.

# Introduction

## Introduction and motivations

### General Context

The World Wide Web, based on the HyperText protocol, has been one of the most disruptive technological change in the
recent past. The amount of information that is accessible through the WWW has become incredibly huge. IBM predicted in
2006[#TTT][] that by 2010, the amount of information available would double every 11 hours. People also use more and
more this available knowledge. While the WWW was, a couple of years ago, mainly used by computer scientist or people
that were somehow working with computers, the mobile trend is bringing additional people online everyday.

While a lot of these new people come online to connect with peers, an incredible amount of them also come online to get
access to additional knowledge. Using a search engine such as Google, Yahoo! or Bing has become the daily routine, not
to say the hourly routine for many.

But while knowledge is _accessible_, it does not necessary means that it is _reachable_. In other words, people
might only be a couple of clicks away from the exact information they need, but still unable to reach it because they
have no directions to go in.

Search engines thrive to change this fact, but while their progression has been impressive in the beginning, they soon
hit the limits of standard techniques in _information retrieval_.

One of the limits does not actually come directly from the _techniques_ themselves but from the way human beings deal
with looking for information. Human beings are constantly _in context_ and naturally use this context to give additional
meaning to every information they deal with. For instance, if you ask someone in a shop how much a given item costs,
and she answers to you "5", you will automatically understand that this means _"5 euros"_ because the current context
defines for instance the currency, and the item you asked about clearly is more expensive than 5 cents, for instance.

When they query search engines, human beings work the same way, they express what they think their _information need_
is.  But in practice, previous work have shown that most of the queries performed on web search engines can be
considered as  "ambiguous". What "ambiguous" here means is that although we might have all the technology necessary to
retrieve the  information the user needs, the way users expressed their information need is not precise enough for us
to reply with the exact information they are asking. In other terms: we are missing the user context. In their most
dramatic form ambiguous queries can have completely opposite meanings depending on what the context is. The renowned
example of "Java"  in computer science shows it well: Java is both the name of a programming language and the name of a
touristic island. The documents containing the information the user needs when asking for "Java" have close to no
chances to be the same in both contexts.

With this in mind, a solution would be that instead of expecting the user to disambiguate the query by herself, to
understand the context in which the user is querying the web search engine in order to personalize her search. Such
systems are called _context-aware systems_.

Among the first to talk about search personalization were L. Page and S. Brin in 1998 when they first wrote about the
PageRank algorithm[#PR98][]. PageRank algorithm's goal is to differentiate pages that have all close scores in terms of
relevancy to the user's query. As such, they suggested that the PageRank algorithm, which at that time was seen as a way
to tweak the already-computed scores of the relevant pages, could be personalized to a "user's point of view". They
tested at first by creating a PageRank from a "web page's point of view" (as this was easily done using PageRank
implementation they had at that time) and obtained significantly different top results depending on whether the web page
they used was talking about Computer Science or Sports, for instance[#PR98][].

[#PR98]: The PageRank citation ranking: Bringing order to the web. L Page, S Brin, R Motwani, T Winograd - 1999

As a consequence of this experiment, they suggested that future work could lead to personalization of the PageRank using
information directly coming from the user, such as bookmarks or frequently/recently visited web pages. Those URLs,
coming directly from the user would make the PageRank consider "importance" of web pages against the view of the user
according to what the user browse most often.

Search personalization is an example of a _context-aware system_. Research in search personalization has gone a long way
since Brin and Page talked about it and many different techniques now exist.

Outside of the problem of _user modeling_, search personalization techniques propose different approaches to
personalizing the results to the user. Some of them will target the categories the user is interested in, some other will
use information from similar groups in order to provide the user with content she would not reach else.

We are contributing to the field with a new one that uses information from previous user behavior by using the logs of
the web search engine in order to alter the way we apply PageRank to the web graph and as a result, alter the results
that the end user will receive.

### Research Questions [resquestions]

As discussed previously, _context-aware_ systems need context. In the field, the context that is tied to a user is
generally called the _user profile_ and is based often based on a _user model_ that describes what we want to integrate
in every user profile in order to provide the application with the necessary information to provide personalized
services.

This brings the first task of the thesis.

###### The User Model:

- Representing the user interests
- Enabling PageRank personalization
    + Related to specific nodes of the graph (link, URL).
    + With a scoring function that ranks the level of interests of the user for this node.

Having a good user model in hand is unfortunately not enough. Indeed, as it has been studied in the past, the vast
majority of users a reluctant to providing context such as user interests by themselves[#paradox87][].

One way to overcome this issue is the use the information about the user interests that we can _infer_ from their
actions instead of asking them to explicit them.

Several ways of doing this have been proposed in the past. In the case of web search personalization, two sources of
user interests are generally pointed at: browsing history and/or search/clicks logs.

Search/clicks logs actually integrate partial browsing history information. Indeed, if a user issued a given query to
the web search engine, she obviously visited the search engine page in order to do that, which is a first browsing
history  information. The second browsing history information we get comes from what is called the _dwell time_ between
clicks on the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). We can infer from there, with an acceptable certainty[#dwelltimes][],
whether the user was actually satisfied with the link he clicked on or not.

In our research, we will here consider search/clicks logs as the source of information. Which brings the second task.

###### The Usage Mining:

- Using search engine logs in such a way that they provides necessary information for PR personalization

Having mined the data, we need to turn it into something that makes sense in a _collaborative_ way. Indeed, in this work
we want to achieve _group_ personalization where you gain advantage of the other users that are similar to you in order
to improve your experience. We decide to position our work this way because single user personalization has proven to
be less efficient[#lle][] and can also only improve results on queries that the user would have already issued in the
past.

The _collaboration_ is going to be our third task.

###### The Collaboration:

- Representing users similarity with each other
    + Defining a scoring function that ranks similarity of two given users on a scale
- Comparing users between them
    + Modeling profiles such that they allow such similarity computation
- Exploiting similar users' interests to improve personalization of PR
    + Defining a group-based PageRank personalization score

Finally, the last task our work is going to be about is to use the graph structure of the web as final means of
applying the search personalization re-ranking based on the previously collaboratively-computed scores. For this, we
will use PageRank computation personalization.

###### The Computation Personalization:

- Using PageRank in such a way that personalizing it provides personalization to the results pages


The main objective of this master thesis being to answer whether or not using PageRank as a means of collaborative web
search personalization provides good results, we can say that we attempt to answer the following research questions:

1. _What data from the clicks logs should we use to provide personalization to the end user through PageRank?_
2. _How should the user profile be constructed to allow collaborative personalization of the SERP through PageRank?_
3. _How well can the personalization of a graph-based scoring provide personalization to the end user?_
4. _How can one evaluate web search personalization in the case of search results re-ranking through PageRank?_

### Contribution [introcontrib]

In this master thesis, we design a model and a personalization system based on the analysis of usage. The main idea of
the personalization system is to exploit the history of clicks as past interactions of users, using web search
engines logs. The second main idea is to personalize a web-graph-based ranking by using the click logs information to
attach personalized scores to nodes of the graph.

In our approach, we chose to work with PageRank as the web graph ranking algorithm for several reasons: first, it is the
most broadly used, second, it directly provides means of personalization using the _personalization vector_ that is part
of the original PageRank formula[#PR98][], and finally, PageRank personalization has proven to be effective in the
past[#tspr][].

The main components of the personalization system that we present here are:

- Search/clicks logs processing and data [gathering and enrichment][usagemining]  
Here we deal with extracting the data from a simple search/clicks logs. Additional processing will be needed and
sometimes the logs will also need to be enriched before being fully usable in the context of our [personalization
techniques][serprequery].

- Users collaboration based on their history of clicks and the semantic relationships of the [their 
queries][usagemining]  
We define a similarity function between users that takes both into account the semantic distance between users and the
clicks they issued in the past.

- Collaborative PageRank Personalization based on collaboratively personalized scores of web graph nodes  
We execute a personalized computation of the PageRank by using its _personalization vector_ together with a set of
collaboratively personalized coefficients for the nodes of the graph for which we have been able to extract users past 
clicks.

- A user interface to allow for _user study_-based evaluation as in previous works[#tspr][][#predictpath][]  
We build web UI to allow user studies to be performed and to allow users to easily give formal and sound preferences
towards a ranking versus the other one as well as naturally and transparently expressing their precision judgment of 
the [displayed rankings][studyprotocol].

### Thesis Organization [thesisorg]

In the remaining parts of the current manuscript, you will find the following parts:

- A state of the art  
[][relwork] will provide a review of the previous related works and provide insights on what has already been attempted and
succeeded in the past and what are their limits. The state of the art will be divided into two majors parts: Personalized/
Recommender Systems and Personalized PageRank. The earlier will review different techniques of user profiling as well as
recommendation and personalization systems themselves. The latter will review previous works on techniques to 
personalize PageRank scores and their applications.

- Our contribution to the field: Collaborative(ly) Personalized PageRank  
[][cpprmain] will provide the details of our work, divided into two main topics.  We will first discuss the _usage mining_
side of the work and how data is being processed and handled all the way from raw clicks logs to web graph nodes scoring
based on semantically similar users past behaviors. We will then explain how those scores are integrated into the
PageRank computation.

- A thourough experimentation and evaluation review  
[][expe] will finally present how we actually implemented such a personalized system. As with the rest of the work, we
will emphasize on reproducibility of the current work and provide everything that is needed for future work in the
domain and/or to do the experiment again in the first chapters of [][expe]. The [last chapter][evaluation] will present
our evaluation methodology and present an analysis of the experimental results that we gathered.

The dissertation will then end with conclusion about the presented work, how the research questions have been answered
and discussion about future work.

# Related Work [relwork]

## Introduction

In this part of the work, we are going to review and present previous works that are related to what we are working on.

More specifically, we will first briefly review general work on _context-aware_ systems in [][contextrelwork] as _search
personalization_ is a type of _context-aware_ system. But we will not go into details as we are going to quickly focus
on _personalized search_ in [][persosearchrelwork] and will more specifically review it from the point of view of
_recommender systems_. We will first review how _user profiling_, which is a type of _context modeling_, has been done
in the past in recommender systems and personalized search. We are not going to do a fully detailed state-of-the-art on
personalized search for the simple reason that this field is a huge research domain and it would be both impractical and
also partially irrelevant to review works on all different types of _search personalization_. Finally, the very last
section of [][relwork] will focus on previous works that have been conducted on _personalized pagerank_.

"Context-aware" term was first introduced, together with context-aware computing, by Schilit and
Theimer[#schilit_context][] in 1994.

By the time Anind K. Dey and Gregory D. Abowd[#abowd_context][] wrote in 1999 about context and context-awareness, they
were already able to find about a dozen different definitions of _context_ in the literature.

While context was originally perceived mainly as a matter of location and time, context has then been considered not
simply as a state but as a part of a process in which users are involved[#coutax_context][].

Anind K. Dey and Gregory D. Abowd[#abowd_context][] tried to give a more general and formal definition of context:
Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place, or
object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and
applications themselves.

While this is a handy definition to be able to tell what is or is not a context, this keeps things quite abstract and
not especially formal in terms of manipulation of this context by an application.

[#coutax_context][] tries to give another general definition of a context while being closer to what an application can
actually manipulate: "context is about evolving, structured, and shared information spaces, and that such spaces are
designed to serve a particular purpose".

As a consequence of the variety of context definitions, is the variety of definitions of a _context-aware system_, also
named a _context-aware application_. Once more, we will take here the definition given in[#abowd_context][] as follows:
A system is context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where
relevancy depends on the user's task.

We prefer this definition over more specific ones as, for instance, if in the case of search personalization the user's
task is to retrieve some sort of information, to fill her information needs, user's task might change in the case of a
recommendation system where the user might not especially be filling in her information needs but just acting for some
sort of other activity as filling in a form, writing a message in a web page and so on. We might still want to be able
to define what a recommendation system would be in such context. A more specific definition of a context-aware system,
such as a system that would for instance take into account user's location, time, date and currently approximated
information needs, would not allow us to define a recommendation system outside of the information retrieval activity
anymore.

The idea of information spaces in the previous definition of context brings us to the need of a context model. A context
model is used to define the enclosing environment of some system under study. In other words, the context is the
surrounding element for the system, and a model provides the mathematical interface and a behavioral description of the
surrounding environment.

[#schilit_context][] defines a context model as the container that will basically allow a context-aware system to take
action based on its content.

<!-- \pagebreak -->

[#schilit_context][] and[#badlauf_context][] review a lot of different data-oriented context models and agree on the
fact that they can basically be categorized as follows:

- Context as a matter of channel-device-presentation.
- Context as a matter of location and environment.
- Context as a matter of user activity.
- Context as a matter of agreement and sharing (among groups of peers).
- Context as a matter of selecting relevant data, functionalities and services (data or functionality tailoring).

Models of the first category take the application as the subject of study. Their main advantage is to have a centrally
defined context that can be automatically learned and updated and a variable context granularity. But they have limited
flexibility in terms of subject to study and in the end are often quite low-level which makes them well suited for a
limited scope application only. CoDaMoS[#50][] and SOCAM[#51][] can be classified in this category.

Models of the second category generally provide space and time management, based on a centralized context definition
too. They have the advantage of allowing information quality management and disambiguation (sometimes) which makes them
a bit more flexible. They unfortunately generally have very limited context reasoning. "CASS"[#49][] is an example of
such systems.

Models of the third category focus of "what the user is doing". They generally provide with context history, thus
allowing context reasoning, which are their main advantages. They are still generally centralized. Automatic learning of
user activity from sensor readings is another interesting technique sometimes employed in such systems.

The fourth category is focused on groups approach and the problem of reaching an agreement about a context shared among
peers. As such, the context definition is here distributed. Sophisticated time and location information is needed in
order to reach the goal of such systems. In order to provide context reasoning or context quality monitoring, they
however have to get rid of the low level issues and provide a high level of formality which is often quite hard to
implement. CoBrA [48] could be seen as an example of this category.

The last category focuses on how the context determines which data and/or application features. To achieve such goals,
time, space and user profile are commonly present and have to be highly developed in order to allow context reasoning
and as a consequence decision making, to choose which data or application features need to be enabled or disabled.
ConceptualCM [52] is an example of this category.

## Recommender Systems and Personalized Search [persosearchrelwork]

### Personalized Search As A Recommender System

In this section, we are going review the literature about two topics: Recommender systems and personalized search. The
reason we are grouping these subjects together is because we believe they are fundamentally the same thing. More
specifically, personalized search is in our opinion a type of recommender system.

Indeed, the role of a recommender system is to select, from a huge set of items, which ones are best suited for a given
user. The most known and simple recommender systems are probably the movies recommendation systems or Amazon.com's items
recommender system. In such systems, among a huge set of items (all of the world's movies, all Amazon's items), the
system's role is to select a given sequence of _top-suited items_ that the user will be presented, as the user cannot
deal with the entire set of items and select from them by herself, because there are two many of them.

In its simplest form, and as it appeared first in the literature, a recommender system is based on _ratings_ of items by
users of the system. Users rate items that they have watched, listened, read or used. The role of the recommender system
is basically to _guess_ what rating the user would give to an item that the user has _not rated yet_. Let us call  $r(u,
i)$ the rating given by the user $u$ to the item $i$, then the recommender system should _extrapolate_ the value of
$r(u, j)$ where $j$ has not been rated by $u$ yet.

Personalized search is nothing different from this. In personalized search, the set of items can be thought as all
documents, or web pages that have been returned by the information retrieval engine. In most cases and for modern search
engines, the number of those documents is definitely huge[^pizzagoogle], and too big for the user to make a selection by
herself. Thus, the system has to select the _top suited items_ out of all the items that are similarly relevant to a
query, and present this sequence of items to the user.

[^pizzagoogle]: "pizza" on Google.com returns $203,000,000$ results as of August $21^{th}$, 2014.

Moreover, a _rating_, in the case of personalized search, can be thought as the _relevancy_ of a given item to a given
query string and a given user. If users were to rate every web page that they read, the personalized search problem
would become exactly similar as the one of guessing the rating a user would give to a given web page she has not rated
yet. In information retrieval terms, a _guessed rating_ $r(u, q, p)$ ($u$ is the user, $q$ the query, $p$ the web page)
becomes in our case the probability that the web page $p$ is going to fulfill the _information need_ expressed by $u$
via the query $q$. Of course, users do not rate all web pages they visit, but users do not rate all movies they watch or
all books they read either, thus this is not any different from the standard problem of recommender systems.

As we will see, the relationship between personalized search and recommender systems does not stop there. Personalized
search works in the literature definitely made use of techniques from recommender systems and can easily be classified
as such.

As a consequence, we will approach the literature review of personalized search systems from the point of view of
recommender systems.

### User Profiling [userprofiling]

#### Introduction

A _user model_ can represent very different sets of data. It can go from a pure _context model_ as we discussed it
previously, for instance broadly defined, trying to gather as much information as possible, to a very restricted and
focused model, for instance _user interests_ models, where the only important information is the distribution of
probabilities of interest over a set of categories for instance. This last case  is generally called _user profiling_.

As we already briefly discussed _context modeling_ more generally in the [previous section][contextrelwork], we are
going to focus in this section on _user profiles_ that have been used in recommender systems and/or personalized search.

<!-- 
% "The consumer side of search: Personalized search", Pitkow 2002: Composed of previous browsing history
-->

We are going to review previous literature grouped by the following criteria:

1. What is the content of the user profile? What data does it track?
2. What is the representation of the user profile? What structure is used to store it and what advantage does it have?
3. What data is it based on?

As part of $3.$ we will also be able to discuss explicitly provided data vs. implicitly collected data. As part of $2.$
we will also be able to discuss dynamic vs. static profiles and adaptive vs. static profiles.

The user profile content is generally composed of two types of elements: basic elements and/or composite/aggregated
elements.

The first case can for instance be seen in[#armstrong][][#bollacker][][#kim][][#shen][][#abel][] where the profile
content is composed of keywords. Other basic elements can include _queries_ themselves, in the case of personalized
search or even clicks, as in[#largescaleeval][]. Basic elements have the advantage of being easy to both manipulate and
understand. However, if a profile is only composed of keywords, for instance, the limitation is then that profiles
are prone to ambiguous keywords. Similar profiles could in fact represent not so similar users because of the
different  meanings every user puts behind her words. One way to overcome this limitation is to provide semantics.
Another way is to combine basic elements with composite elements (that can also bring semantics) in order to
disambiguate  them.

Composite elements are enriched or enhanced elements, sometimes aggregation of basic elements. This can be clusters, as
in[#kim][] and[#lyes][]. But this can also more simply be categories. Categories are probably the most often used
elements of user profiles in personalized search, profiles of categories can for instance be found
in[#profile_fang][],[#pazzani_profile][],[#pitkow_persosearch][] and[#largescaleeval][]. Note that in[#tspr][], profiles
of categories are also used but this time not as the _user_ profile but as the web page profile.

Other works also include "concepts", that are often close to categories in practice, as composite elements. Other
composite  elements that can be found in the literature are also rules, or assumptions. Rules and assumptions could for
instance be "this user does not use this button" or "the program should execute this rule for this user", they can be
found in[#bollacker][] and[#kobsabgp][].

Generally speaking, profiles that only include basic elements will be easier to manipulate and can be easily integrated
in a  variety of applications that will post-process the profile to achieve personalization. On the other hand, profiles
including very elaborated information or information that has been processed heavily will be more suitable for specific
applications. They have the advantage of providing a user profile that is more unique but this will also come at the
price of less possible operations on the profiles themselves (like profile-to-profile cosine-based similarity).

#### User Profile Representation [profilerepr]

[#profile_fang]: F. Liu and C. Yu, "Personalized Web Search by Mapping User Queries to Categories", 2002.
[#pitkow_persosearch]: James Pitkow et. al., Personalized search. Commun. ACM 45, 9, 2002
[#pazzani_profile]: M. Pazzani, "Learning and Revising User Profiles : The Identification of Interesting Web Sites", 1997.

The user profile representation comes along with its content to provide the application with _features_. A  _feature_ of
a user profile is generally a measure or metrics, a value along a given axis (or "dimension"), that will allow the
system to change its behavior depending on it.

While exotic representations have also been published in the past, the main three structures that generally support the
user profile's data are: a vector, a hierarchy or an ontology.

Vectors are the simplest structure found to support the content of the user profile and also quite often a structure
that  works very well. Vectors are used for instance in virtually all works that store user profiles as distributions of
probabilities over a set of categories, we can cite[#profile_fang][],[#pazzani_profile][],[#pitkow_persosearch][]
and[#largescaleeval][] for instance.

In all of those works, using different paths, the authors ultimately constructed a probability vector over a set of
categories that represented the user interest in this specific category.

The experiments have proven that this technique works well:

- [#profile_fang][] managed an accuracy between 80% and 100% in guessing the category a user would have classified her
query into.

- [#pitkow_persosearch][] was able to reduce the number of _user actions_ needed for the user to fulfill her information
need by 90%-105% compared to standard search engines with their project _Outride_.

- [#pazzani_profile][] achieved precisions varying from 60% with the worst tested algorithms to more than 80% in
guessing which page the user would consider as "hot" or "cold" in the category she is currently browsing.

- [#largescaleeval][] observed a significant 23% improvement in search results accuracy.

Hierarchies can be found in[#kobsabgp][] and[#kim][] where they are used in order to represent the relationship between
the topics of interest that are present in the user profiles. It should however be noted that[#kim][] constructs the
hierarchy an interesting technique based on connected subgraphs. Every node being a topic and every edge being a
relationship between a topic and another, they iteratively remove edges that are above a given threshold and keeps the
resulting fully connected  subgraphs as the topics of the given level of the hierarchy.

Hierarchies have the advantage of providing semantics where vectors generally will not. Quite often, they will also rely
on  data structures that allow for _dynamic_ user profiles, that is to say user profiles that are updated while the
application is running and the user is using it, in comparison to vectors that are generally computed once or at
specific  intervals. Hierarchies also allow to perform different treatments depending on the level of the
information. In the case of personalized search, for instance, depending on the ambiguity of the query and previous
click  entropy measures on this query, one can decide to use the higher-level disambiguations categories or lower-level
ones. One could also disambiguate by going through the hierarchy from top to bottom as the research session goes.
Hierarchies also allow level-specific profile-to-profile similarity computation. Finally, many works have been done on
hierarchies shape analysis and this can also constitute a feature, as used in[#kim][].

On the other hand, vectors also have advantages. For instance, they generally benefit from a wider set of proven and
robust  mathematical tools such as average vectors, many sort of similarities functions (as in[#largescaleeval][]), but
also, representations: data visualization eases the work of researchers in understanding behaviors and results of
algorithms, allowing for faster iteration and improvement of research works. Linear combinations are also often used,
such as in[#tspr][].

To summarize it, we could say that hierarchies generally provide higher-level features and more dynamic profiles, and
even  _adaptive_ profiling methods. Adaptive methods are methods that will act differently depending on the context and
the current user profile. While vectors would provide a higher number of operability features: post treatment,
mathematical operations,  etc. ...

Finally, examples of ontologies as the structure of the user profile can be found in[#abel][] and[#middleton][]. Ontology have not widely
been used yet and their use is quite often close to the one of a set of hierarchies, but with a semantic meaning to
different levels and different hierarchies of the set.

#### User Profile Data Basis/Data Collection [profiledata]

The user profile data "basis" is what the user profile is based on. This can sometimes be straightforward data  that is
directly included in the profile but sometimes it can be pretty different from what ends up in the final profile.

We will differentiate mainly two types of data collection: explicit or implicit.

In explicit data collection, either the users are asked to explicitly provide the necessary data to generate their user
profile or they are asked to provide data as part of another task and this data ultimately serves as the basis of the
user  profile generation.

Explicit data collection can be found in numerous works in the past, such as[#kobsabgp][][#bollacker][][#middleton][].

Explicit data collection has obvious advantages:

- There is no need for heuristics about what kind data should be used to generate what type of user profiles.

- The user profile _precision_ is at its highest.

- The user can easily decide about what to provide and what not to provide in terms of data, thus avoiding privacy issues of 
data collection.

- If the user sees that the personalization/recommendation engine does not behave as she thought it would by providing such 
information, she can fix her profile in accordance.

To summarize: user control and precision are the main advantages. But one should also note that the _amount_ of data
necessary to generate a complete user profile will also likely be much lower. Indeed, in implicit data collection, we
often  need a significantly higher amount of data to generate a profile as we need to make sure the data is interpreted
correctly by having confirming data. For instance, if a user clicks _once_ on a link, we cannot really say whether she
is  satisfied with this link, but if she clicks 40 times on this link over a total of 50 clicks, then we are pretty
accurate.

Unfortunately, explicit data collection also has significant drawbacks:

- It is generally costly.

- It is not automated (which goes along with costly).

- Users might still misunderstand questions asked by the system or how to use it and could provide completely wrong
information.

But the main drawback remains the following: users simply do _not_ want to provide explicit profiles/preferences as it
has  been shown in the past[#paradox87][]. Thus, in addition to being costly, such explicit data collection will simply
not  be applicable when it comes to real world users.

Implicit data collection, on the other hand, has significant advantages, basically where explicit data collection has
drawbacks:

- It is automated, and thus can be scaled more easily without necessarily leading to huge costs.

- It can be transparent to the user. Indeed, it can be done on data the system already collects in order to fulfill its
task  anyway.

- It reflects the _real_ usage of the users: how they use the system in the _general_ case, not in the special case
of  being explicitly asked question about this or that.

- Significantly higher amounts of data can be integrated in a given user profile as a consequence of the process being
automated.

- The profile can be updated automatically without the need of any user action.

- Multiple profiles can be generated for a given user without necessarily multiplying the amount of resources or time
necessary to generate them compared to having a single profile.

- As computer resources get cheaper and cheaper, automated processes get cheaper at the same time (while human resources tend
to get more expensive over time).

The list can obviously be extended to all advantages and drawbacks of automated systems vs. human-driven/manual systems,
but  we think the point is clear with these few advantages highlighted. Past works using solely implicitly collected
data include[#largescaleeval][][#armstrong][][#kim][][#shen][] and[#abel][].

Their most common drawbacks include:

- Precision and interpretation: One needs to build a model and transformation function from the collected data to the
final  user profile. Also, the collected data will generally be less specific and carry less information in the case of
implicitly  collected data compared to data provided directly by the user (example: X clicks over Y clicks vs. "I was 
satisfied with this link, I would rate it 4/5").

- Big data implications: as discussed in the introduction of the thesis about the _toxic terabyte_[#TTT][], modern
systems tend  to accumulate so much data that it becomes sometimes impossible to work with it.

- Privacy concerns: the collected data, and moreover its analysis, could reveal information about the user that she
would not not want to be inferred and even less to be integrated into her profile. While with explicitly collected data,
she would have been able to simply not answer or provide false information the corresponding questions.

- Legal concerns: often a direct consequence of the privacy concerns, governments tend to regulate more and more the
implicitly collected user data and it can sometimes become quite hard to legally collect enough data for the
personalized/recommender system to function properly.

As we can see, while implicit data collection seems to still be the best choice in our opinion between explicit and
implicit  collection, both have advantages that cannot be ignored. This is one of the reasons why many past approaches
to  user profiling actually use both explicit and implicitly collected data, among the previous works that make use of
both we can cite[#kobsabgp][][#bollacker][][#middleton][].

### Applications in Recommender Systems and Personalized Search [persosearchrelwork_application]

Based on the previously described user profiles, recommender systems generate recommendations to the users.

When recommending a given item to a given user, recommender systems and personalized search can globally be classified
as using one of the following combinations of sources of information:

1. Only user's profile and item's profile 
2. User's profile and all (or a subset of) items' profiles 
3. All (or a subset of) users' profiles and item's profile 
4. All (or a subset of) users' profiles and all (or a subset of) item's profile 

Depending on the sources used, recommender and personalized search systems are classified as follows:

1. Content-based recommender systems: Items will be recommended based on similarity to the ones the user already rated
or preferred in some way in the past. Such systems will use sources of information 1. and/or 2. in the above list.

2. Collaborative recommender systems: Items will be recommended based on what similar (tastes, preferences...) people
preferred in the past. Those systems will use sources of information 3. in the above list.

3. Hybrid recommender systems: here, items will be recommended combining both methods. Those systems will use any of the
sources of information previously described and sometimes even additional ones.

In[#eirinaki][], the authors use as similar classification of personalized search systems. They name the two first
_content-based filtering_ and _collaborative filtering_. In addition to these two categories, they also define two
other categories as follows:

- Rule-based filtering systems ask the users questions. They then extract rules from the answers and then applies these
rules to deliver appropriate content to the users.

- Web usage mining personalized systems provide personalization by applying data mining techniques to web usage data.

We believe, however, that rule-based filtering is just a specific case of content-based filtering. Indeed, in the end
the  system will use only the user profile (composed of rules) and the items profiles. And, in the end, the rules are
used in  order to recommend items but the items themselves are matched to the rules based on their content anyway. One
could argue that _content-based filtering_ is only about user profiles being composed of _contents_, but we
prefer to classify recommender systems by their source of data as we believe this is what changes the most the way they
work. There is indeed fewer difference between two systems that are both building a user profile - in two different
ways - and items profiles and then make recommendations based on features of the user profile and features of the items
profiles than there are between such systems and a collaborative filtering system, that will do user-to-user comparisons
and base its recommendation on those comparisons rather than on comparisons to items profiles.

In the end, the classification of ruled-based filtering systems will depend, in our opinion, on the way the set of rules
have  been defined. If the set of rules is statically defined, we believe the system is just a special case of 
content-based  filtering. However, in[#rulediscovery][] for instance, the rules are themselves defined by detecting patterns in
implicitly collected user data. In this case, an additional source of information is thus indirectly used at the time of
the  recommendation and this would classify itself as a hybrid recommender system.

[#rulediscovery]: S. W. Ave, "Effective Personalization Based on Association Rule Discovery from Web Usage Data."

As per _web usage mining_, the classification will greatly depend on what data is analyzed by the _data mining
technique_ that is used: Is the data collaborative? Is it based on items' content?

For instance, in[#channelswebreco][], the authors describe their system as a hybrid recommender system, their
technique integrates patterns and behaviors in the user profiles and they also analyze item-to-item relationships,
which can basically be summarized as an advanced user profile and item content analyze and the use of both profiles to make 
the final recommendation.

System."

In the two following sections, we are going to review in more details content-based filtering and hybrid filtering
recommender systems and web search personalized systems. More specifically, we are going to focus on their application
in personalized search re-ranking, as this is the main topic of our research. Re-ranking, as opposed to query rewriting,
will apply a second algorithm on  top of the IR scoring, in order to select the top set of items that are recommended to
the user, among the set of returned  items by IR engine. It is generally opposed to query rewriting, that we will not
cover here, which is a technique where the query is generally enriched, or simply transformed, so that the IR engine
returns results that are tailored to the current user. For each category (content-based, hybrid), we will present its
specificities, advantages and main limits.

#### Content-based filtering: User-level Re-ranking [contentbasedfiltering]

Tapestry," Comm. ACM, vol. 35, no. 12, pp. 61-70, 1992.

Content-based filtering can be observed in numerous previous works, such as[#8][][#10][][#11][].

It has been applied more specifically to web search personalization in for instance[#tspr][][#largescaleeval][] and
more recently[#eexcess][].

One of the main criticism that can be found against content-based filtering recommender systems is that, as their only
source of information to estimate matching between a given item and the user's profile is the set of features of the
items themselves, they are also inherently limited to items that are easily subject to automated parsing.

However, in the application of web search personalization, this limit is not necessarily an issue. If we limit the scope
to  web pages search (hypertext documents), such documents are very easily subject to automated parsing. And even
hypertext  features are anyway defined from the content of the web page and can thus be inferred by automated parsing
easily. This makes this criticism towards content-based filtering not really relevant in the context of web search
personalization.

A second main criticism is the general high sensibility of such systems to feature selection by the system's designer.
Indeed , in the case of item recommendation problem, even if two items are not the same, if their profile against the
set of selected features to match the user's profile is the same, such items will basically be recommended equally. In
the case of web search personalization, however, the issue has much less impact. Indeed, the IR engine will take into
account the whole document anyway and it is responsible for scoring documents based on their entire content. The
recommender system comes in second position and helps rework those scores so that they fit better the user profile. Two
items that are different enough, even if they have the same profile against the recommender system, will be
differentiated at the  first stage of the system, when the IR engine is run. Once more, this drawback has much less
impact in  the use case of web search personalization.

Where content-based filtering systems show their main limits, when applied to web search personalization, however, is
when it comes to the _new user problem_, that we could also generally call the _cold start problem_.

What this problem means is that, as content-based systems only use the user profile, at one end, and items profiles at
the  other end, they will in fact only be able to _extrapolate_ the utility of an item regarding a user (and regarding
an information need, in web search) if the user already has a profile containing similar items (or similar queries). In
the general case of recommender systems, this is mainly when a "new user" comes into the system. But in the case of web
search,  this problems appears every time the user makes a query unrelated to everything she has done in the past. For
instance, if a user has a profile containing queries about surfing, tourism and travels, the recommender system will be
pretty  accurate differentiating items when the user will query for "java" between "Java Island" items and "Java
Programming Language" items. But if this very user then queries for "mouse", the system will not really have any
accuracy in knowing whether this  is about the animal or the computer device. Although "java" was already in the
profile, it was disambiguated to not being related to computers and thus, we have no real information on what to
recommend to the user for the query "mouse".

This is where collaborative approaches and hybrid approaches will show their strength, as we will discuss in the next
section.

#### Collaborative & Hybrid Filtering: Group-level Re-ranking

Collaborative filtering systems have had their moment of opulence, countless works have deployed variations of the
collaborative filtering method in the past. Among them,[#8][][#channelswebreco][][#10][][#11][] are for instance
popular examples. More recently, the approach was also benchmarked in[#largescaleeval][].

In collaborative filtering, as explained in [][persosearchrelwork_application], the source of data used for the
recommendation or the personalization is not only the current user profile anymore, but all or a subset of users
profiles. The main advantage of doing so is, in the case of personalized search, that it overcomes the _new query
problem_ where a user cannot be recommended anything if he has not already previously issued the query.

This is a significant advantage. Indeed, while _repeated queries_ generally account for about 33% of the
queries[#largescaleeval][], which is significant, this would still mean that the personalization cannot be executed for
67% of the  queries, which obviously significantly reduces its scope of application. Moreover, consider a user that has
already issued an ambiguous query in the past: if she had low quality results and reformulated the query, she will
probably directly query using the reformulated query the next time, especially considering the _auto-completion_
mechanism now in place in modern browsers.

Collaborative filtering systems can generally be categorized as either _memory- based_ or _model-based_.

The most common memory-based systems base their recommendations on a set of _similar users_ to the current user. The
similarity generally depends on the content of the user profile. It is generally defined as a function that takes as
input  two users, or two user profiles, and returns their _similarity_, respecting the standards of a _similarity
function_, that is to say:

<!-- 
\begin{centering}
\begin{multiline}
0.0 \le sim(u_1, u_2) \le 1.0 \\
sim(u_1, u_1) = 1.0 \\
sim(u_1, u_2) = sim(u_2, u_1) \\
\end{multiline}
\end{centering}
 -->
The closer the similarity to 1.0, the more similar the users are, and the closest to 0, the less similar they are. This
is  not to be confused with a _distance function_, though, as this does not necessarily respects the triangle
inequality, and $sim(u_1, u_2) = 1.0 \centernot\implies u_1 = u_2$.

Once the set of most similar users is defined, the system will then use a heuristic to generate an aggregated score out
of the items scores against each of the profiles of the similar users. The most straightforward approach is for instance
to  simply average the item score over the set of similar users. This, however, gives as much importance to a user that
is  very similar to the current user and a user that twice less similar for instance. This can be overcome by using a
weighted average using the similarity score as the weight, for instance. This is what is done in[#largescaleeval][] for
instance, and this is also what we will use in our work.

In[#largescaleeval][], the score of a web page $p$ is based on the ratio of clicks made on this web page compared to
all clicks made for the given query:

$$score(q, p, u) = \cfrac{|Clicks(q, p, u)|}{|Clicks(q, \bullet, u)|}$$

where $Clicks(q, p, u)$ is the number of clicks that the user performed on web page $p$ on the SERPs of the query $q$
and $Clicks(q, \bullet, u)$ is the  total number of clicks for user $u$ for the query $q$.

Then, the collaboratively aggregated score is the weighted average over the set $\mathcal{S}_u$ of top similar users to
$u$:

$$aggre(q, p, u) = \cfrac{
    \sum\limits_{u_s \in \mathcal{S}_u}{sim(u, u_s) \cdot score(q, p, u_s)}
}{
\beta + \sum\limits_{u_s \in \mathcal{S}_u}{|Clicks(q, \bullet, u_s)|}
}$$

where $\beta$ is a smoothing constant of $0.5$ in the case of[#largescaleeval][].

<!-- %[Improve: If motivation comes back, add analyze of other cited works] -->

Model-based systems, on the other hand, generally consider the _rating guessing_ problem from a probabilistic point of
view. Indeed, one can consider that the recommendation score to be assigned to a non-yet-rated item for a given user
is the _expected value_ of a vote.[#empanalcf][] suggests to formalize it with the following formula:

$$E(v_{u,j}) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{m}{i \times Pr(v_{u,j} = i | v_{u,k}, k \in I_u)}$$

with $v_{u,j}$ the vote of user $u$ for the item $j$ and $E(v_{u,j})$ the expected value of such vote.

Based on this formula, model-based systems make their best to provide an estimation of the value of $Pr(v_{u,j} = i |
v_{u,k}, k \in I_u )$.

Among previously used techniques, one can find a wide range of approaches: Bayesian networks are common, but neural
networks  and probabilistic relational models as well as linear regression and maximum entropy model can also be found in
the literature[#40][][#41][][#42][].

However, when it comes to personalized search recommender systems, we have found no evidences of a purely model-based
collaborative filtering system. Instead, most of them use a hybrid approach, combining memory-based and model-based
approaches.

This is the case with[#largescaleeval][] for instance. In[#largescaleeval][], the memory-based component is using the
number of clicks from the logs. But the final rating is not only an aggregation of ratings, it also uses the Bayesian
classification of web pages into categories.

[#cchb10][] is another example of a hybrid recommender system applied to web search. In this case the authors constitute
 _generative_ models (from probability theory) on which they base their recommendation. But the generative model itself is based on
clicks and documents contents.

[#dwelltimes][] and[#longshortclicks][] also use hybrid approaches to web search personalization, combining mathematical
theory and memory-based principles of aggregation.

## PageRank [relworkpr]

### Introduction

Numerous previous works have been done on PageRank personalization, among the most notable we can
cite[#partialpr][][#effcomputepr][][#blockpr][], but those works only focus on the PPR computation itself and how to
make it more efficient, to scale it or to compute it differently from the standard PR computation presented in[#PR98][].
However, we found that only[#PR98][] and[#tspr][] studied ways to _apply_ the PPR to improving web search results.
Application of PPR have also been discussed, for instance in[#predictpath][] and[#folksrank][] but not applied to web
search.

Web search ranking is not an easy task. Information retrieval techniques have gone a long way since the beginning of
their application to the world wide web, even sometimes taking into account the context of a document to provide better
ranking results, but they are still fundamentally limited by what they analyze: text, contents. The world wide web is a
graph and as a graph that is being actively managed by individuals and constantly changing, it does not only provide
_documents_ but a  whole _environment_. This environment contains for instance communities, it also contains hierarchies
between pages, authorities, hubs, weak links and strong links, amongst other features. Those features can provide with
far more relevant information on whether a given _page_, or _web document_ should be ranked higher than another one or
not.

It is especially true if two web documents have very similar - not to say equal - contents. In this case, IR-based
techniques cannot provide any differentiation between the documents: those documents _are_ the same, they are just not
_located_ in the same place in the WWW graph.

And while it might have been an edge case in the early days of the web, with the modern expansion of the WWW, documents
that have equal contents are far more common.

This is more or less the original ideas behind the original PageRank work: How would one rank web documents other than
by their content?  Could we define an "importance" measurement that we could tag every unique web document (URL) with,
so that even if two documents are the same we still have ways to differentiate them?

Since its publication in 1998[#PR98][] PageRank has found its application domain ever expanding, as it basically is a
quite robust way to give an importance score to nodes in many sorts of graph.

In this section, we are going to review the previous works that have been done in terms of PageRank applied to web
search and more specifically in terms of _PageRank personalization_, as it was introduced in the original work[#PR98][].
We will not be reviewing here the numerous efforts that have been taken to optimize PageRank, tweak its algorithm to
slightly improve either its runtime computation requirements or its precision. These works relate more to optimization
directly related to the original algorithm and often to mathematical bases of the algorithm (including Markov Chains
theory) than to an actual change in the way PageRank would rank the web graphs for different user profiles.

### PageRank [relworkprpr]

S. Brin and L. Page presented in 1998 an algorithm they called "PageRank"[#PR98][]. PageRank was presented in the
original work as an application of citation-ranking techniques used in research fields to _"bring order to the web"_,
said another way provide an absolute score to every node in the web graph, allowing to order them in a unique ranking.

The PageRank algorithm is based on a "random surfer model". This model's goal is to provide a mathematically formal way
to guess what pages a "perfectly random surfer" would visit. The assumption here is that if the number of _surfers_ is
high enough then the global behavior can be seen as one of a giant unique _perfectly random_ surfer.

The important consideration in the _random surfer model_ is that the surfer will basically perform two possible types of
"move" on the web graph:

- Either she follows a hyperlink, from the web page she is currently viewing, to another web page that is linked by this
page.

- Or she will randomly jump to another node of the graph, with a given probability.

There is not much to be said on the first type of move, but the second type of move provides us with an important
ability. Indeed, if we are computing a _global_, _unbiased_ and user-agnostic PageRank scoring vector, then we probably
want to consider a uniform probability to jump to any node of the graph, as, taken globally, surfers could go anywhere.

But if we have some knowledge on the current user and we are computing a non-user-agnostic, said another way
_personalized_, version of the PageRank scoring vector, we can tweak those probabilities to reflect the actual user
behavior (as a surfer) and interests, thus taking into account the user in the PageRank computation.

Brin et. al. discussed this possibility in their original work. They use what they call themselves the
"_personalization vector_" to compute a PageRank vector that is biased towards the "interests" described by the home
page of a researcher's website. The obtained results are shown in [](#relwork_personalized_pr_pr98).

![Page Ranks for Two Different Views: Netscape vs. John McCarthy (taken from[#PR98][])][relwork_personalized_pr_pr98]

[relwork_personalized_pr_pr98]: relwork_personalized_pr_pr98.png

Results show that the resulting PageRank is indeed dramatically different and the web pages that are the highest ranked
are now web pages with strong relationships with the researcher's home page links.

We will not discuss further the mathematical/formal side of the PageRank algorithm in this section. Indeed, this will be
discussed in details in [][prrecalls] and [][prpersovect]. The _personalization vector_ will specifically be discussed
in details in [][prpersovect].

### Topic-Sensitive PageRank [relworktspr]

While[#PR98][] gave a first glance at how PageRank could be exploited using a Personalized PageRank to achieve search
personalization,[#tspr][] was the first work done on actually implementing an algorithm of personalized PR.

[#tspr][] presents what they call "Topic-Sensitive PageRank" (TSPR). The authors divided the entire Web into 16
categories into which every web page should fit. The 16 categories are the 16 top-level categories of the ODP
directory[#ODP][].

Each page is then computed its TSPR against each of the 16 topics. Each page thus has 16 TSPR scores, one for each of
the 16  computed TSPR vectors instead of a unique score, corresponding to a unique PageRank vector. Each page is also
assigned a probability to belong to one of those categories by using the class-probability of a naive Bayesian
classifier with parameters to their maximum-likelihood.

They then integrate query-time information into the PageRank algorithm by looking at the keywords of the query. They
extract the 4 most probable categories and use a linear weighted combination of the different TSPR vectors in place
of the standard PageRank vector in the PR algorithm.

This approach has advantage over classical information retrieval (with PageRank) that no highly-ranked pages will appear
in the top results _only because they are very popular_. For instance, for a query "java surroundings", Google currently
returns a mix of Java island related results and Java programming language results. Considering the Bayesian classifier
had access to the complete content of the page, pages about Java programming language will have a close to nil
probability to belong to the "travel" class. As a consequence, when the classifier will classify "java surroundings" as
a travel-related query, Java programming results pages will be filtered out.

[#tspr][] evaluates that the average precision of results on the queries that were tested by a group of volunteers
changes from 0.28 with standard PR to 0.51 with TSPR. Unfortunately, their evaluation is a bit weak: A total of 5
volunteers were involved and 10 queries were used. As with[#PR98][], authors suggest to use more sources of context
in order to compute the topics of the query keywords, such as session browsing history or bookmarks.

While it is unfortunate that the approach is a bit weakly evaluated, important considerations for this technique are
that:

1. It reuses PageRank algorithm which has proven to be useful in breaking ties and relative ordering of search results.
2. Authors propose a way to compute it very efficiently, which still today is a concern with ranking algorithms.

### Other Uses of Personalized and Topic-Sensitive PageRank

In this section, we briefly give directions to other works related to PPR.

In[#folksrank][], the Topic-Sensitive PageRank is adapted and used to provide personalized search ranking inside
folksonomies-based systems.

In[#predictpath][], the authors use a website-locally-computed PageRank to predict the next pages that the user is going
to visit. Their application domain is mainly browser and/or proxies pre-caching (proxies cache was also mentionned in
the original PR work[#PR98][])

GFolkRank[#abelfolks][], Personalized SocialPageRank[#abelfolks][], SocialPageRank[#socialpr][] and GRank[#abelfolks][]
also use personalized PageRank or variations of PageRank, however their application is not web search either as they
are primarily aimed at providing recommendation for GroupMe![#groupme][]

### Conclusion on Personalized PageRank [relworkprccl]

We have seen that Personalized PageRank is a subject that has already been discussed in the past. PageRank has a very
wide range of applications and not all of the previous works actually apply to web search re-ranking, even though they
are all context-aware systems.

Topic-Sensitive PageRank was especially close to what we want to achieve in our thesis: providing better web search
results using the personalization vector of the PageRank algorithm to bias the computation towards a set of nodes that
we believe have a higher relevancy to the current query than the average node. But the important limit of TSPR is that,
while it is somehow bringing additional context by the use of a category classifier, the context is not brought directly
by the user. Moreover, the work is limited to 16 pre-defined categories that are not based on the usage of the people
querying the search engine but on an arbitrary dataset (the ODP directory[#ODP][]).

But the most important limits of the previous works on Personalized PageRank applied to web search are certainly the
lack of automation, collaboration and semantical considerations.

In our work, we will focus on filling such gaps. We will do so by providing personalization based on automatically and
implicitly collected usage data (click logs) and a [collaborative approach][usageextraction] combined with a semantic
clustering algorithm (developed in[#lyes][]).

# Collaborative(ly) Personalized PageRank [cpprmain]

## Introduction

In this part we will present the novel approach that our work proposes in terms of using personalized PageRank and usage
mining to provide web search personalization.

We will first present the logs-based usage extraction and how it allows us to compile user profiles.

Then we will explain how we apply collaborative-filtering techniques to these user profiles: how we define user
similarity and how we use this similarity to define a unique score for web graph nodes, to be used in PageRank
personalization.

The last section of this part III will go into the details of how the PageRank is being personalized using results of
the collaborative-filtering scoring.

## Logs-based Usage Mining [usagemining]

The two main goals of our usage mining here are the following:

- Extract user interests: General or more specific areas the user had interest in. Such as "computer science" or
"sports." This gives general information on whether this user is more of a _computer scientist_ for instance or more of
an _accounting  assistant_ for instance.
- Extract user usage: Did the user, considering his interests, mainly preferred this or that link, when issuing requests
of a given categories? Do users who query about "sports", when they make the query "fifa ranking", generally click on
link A or  link B?

The "user interest" here will help us match users together later on, while the "usage" will help us improve actual search 
results based on what users did in the past.

### Logs Keywords Clustering [kwclusters]

The first task in order to be able to say whether user A has interest in "sports" for instance, is to define what
"sports" is. More generally speaking: in order to categorize users interests, we need categories.

Categorizing in the context of web search has been extensively studied in the past. Previous works on search
personalization such as[#largescaleeval][] sometimes reused categorizers from openly-held competition such
as[#kddcup2005][]. As the focus here is not on the _categorization_ problem, that is often seen as an IR problem, we
have decided to reuse a previously developed algorithm. This algorithm, presented in[#lyes][], has interesting
properties that we do not find in most of the former categorizers.

Indeed, while most categorizers use IR techniques, and thus base their analyze of the actual content of a web
document,[#lyes][] bases its analysis on semantical relationships, more precisely on taxonomies.

This has several advantages for us: the first advantage is that it does not require to analyze a huge number of web
documents, avoiding the retrieving and storage costs. But the most important point in not using the web documents
themselves  is: all datasets currently available in terms of search engine logs are relatively old. Web documents will
likely have  changed contents or they might not even be available anymore. The second advantage is that it brings
semantic meanings to the categories it produces. We will not go into details of all the differences between[#lyes][] and
other clustering algorithms here. Another crucial point in the choice of this clustering algorithm was its availability:
most previous research works are not openly accessible (or even not accessible at all), preventing from both proof of
results and from reuse of the work.[#lyes][] clusters have been made  available easily and in an open format that is
easily readable.

Finally, the last interesting point of this clustering algorithm is that it has been evaluated on the same dataset as
the  one our thesis is going to be evaluated on. Which means we can refer to the previously published results in order
to know how good it is on different parts of the dataset and the behavior of the algorithm is predictable.

The algorithm has, among others, a threshold parameter that will basically control the number of outputted clusters. We
chose the 1.314 threshold as a recommendation from the author[#lyes][]. This breaks the entire set of keywords from the
dataset  down into 130 different clusters.

We also have to note that those clusters have been done on a post-processed version of the keywords set extracted from
the  AOL logs: A set of blacklisted keywords, mainly related to pornography, have been pruned. This is absolutely no
problem for  us. Indeed, we could not have used such keywords in the _user study_ anyway, so the clustering provides us
with a way to  prune the set of available queries for evaluation: if a query has a nil clustering vector (nil weights
for all the clusters), then it is thrown away.

### Queries Clustering/Categorization [qclusters]

The keywords clustering brings to us the sets of _categories of interests_ expressed by the entire set of queries and
clicks from the logs. But we do not have a direct mapping from those to the users. The link between the users and those
keywords are queries.

As a consequence, following the original goal of extracting user interests, the next task is to assign to every query
from the logs, a _clustering vector_.

A _clustering vector_ is a one-dimensional vector of as many coordinates as there are clusters. The $i$-th coordinate
corresponds to the probability that the query belongs to the $i$-th cluster. This probability is calculated as follows:

$$c_i(q) = \cfrac{|kw(q, cluster(i))|}{|q|}$$

where $cluster(i)$ represents the $i$-th cluster and $kw(q, cluster(i))$ is the set of common keywords between $q$ and
$cluster(i)$. $|q|$ is the number of keyword of the query that also belong to the global set of keywords of all the
clusters.

As a consequence, the _clustering vector_ for the query $q$ is defined as follows:

$$c(q) = 
\begin{pmatrix}
c_0(q)\\
c_1(q)\\
\vdots\\
c_{130}(q)
\end{pmatrix}$$

### Logs-based Interest Extraction [interestextraction]

The second main task in order to be able to say whether user A has interest in "sports" for instance is to actually
define what "being interested in sports" means. In our case, "being interested in X" means "the amount of clicks user A
performed on X-related queries, compared to other queries".

More formally, we define the interest of user $u$ for the cluster $cluster(i)$ as follows:

$$int(u, cluster(i)) = \sum_{q \in \mathcal{Q}(u)}{P(q|u)c_i(q)}$$

where $\mathcal{Q}(u)$ is the set of queries from the _long-term history_ of user $u$, $c_i(q)$ is the same as
previously defined and $P(q|u)$ can be thought as the probability that user $u$ will click on any result of the query
$q$. It is formally defined using the _long-term history_ of clicks of user $u$ as follows:

$$P(q|u) = \cfrac{clicks(q, u)}{clicks(\bullet, u)}$$

where $clicks(q, u)$ is the number of clicks that the user performed on SERPs of this query and $clicks(\bullet, u)$ is
the  total number of clicks for user $u$. This formula is an adaptation of the work done in[#largescaleeval][] but here
we  aggregate at the query level and not at the page level as our category clustering is done at the query level and not
at the page level.

### User Profile Compilation [profilecompilation]

The overall _user profile_ can be thought at the definition of _user interests_ over the entire set of categories.

Thus, we can define the user profile as follows:

$$c_l(u) = \begin{pmatrix}
int(u, cluster(0))\\
int(u, cluster(1))\\
\vdots\\
int(u, cluster(130))\\
\end{pmatrix}$$

Although, following the idea in[#largescaleeval][] we will consider that queries issued by many users are less
important when building the profile, we will thus define an additional weight $w(q)$ as follows:

$$w(q) = \log{\cfrac{|\mathcal{u}(\bullet)|}{|\mathcal{u}(q)|}}$$

where $\mathcal{u}(q)$ is the set of users who issued query $q$.

The $int()$ function thus becomes:

$$int(u, cluster(i)) = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{Q}(u)}{P(q|u)w(q)c_i(q)}$$

For convenience, we will write the user profile directly in function of the clustering vector of every query of
$\mathcal{Q}(u)$. This gives the following vector equation:

$$c_l(u) = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{Q}(u)}{P(q|u)w(q)c(q)}$$

with $c(q)$ as [previously defined][qclusters].

### Logs-based Usage Extraction [usageextraction]

Now that we have the user profiles defined. What we want to do is to actually _infer_, from user profiles, _usage_ 
information related to multiple users at the same time: _a group_.

First, for a given user $u$, we will defined the _neighborhood of $u$_ as the set of the $K$-nearest neighbors to $u$.

The $K$-nearest neighbors will be computed based on a similarity function.

The similarity between two users $u_1$ and $u_2$ is defined as in[#largescaleeval][], as follows:

$$sim(u_1, u_2) = \cfrac{c_l(u_1) \cdot c_l(u_2)}{||c_l(u_1)||\ ||c_l(u_2)||}$$

Note that, since $c_l(u)$ is a distribution over a semantic clustering of the queries, $sim(u_1, u_2)$ can be considered
as taking into account the _semantic distance_ between the two users. Indeed, $sim()$ is a vector product of two vectors
defined in a "semantic vector space" (and vector space where axis represent semantic concepts/features).

<!-- \pagebreak -->

The $K$-nearest neighbors can then be defined as the $K$ users with the highest similarity. In
mathematical terms, this could be formalized as follows:

Consider the "sequence of ordered users" $\mathcal{U} = (u_0, u_1, ..., u_n)$, such that $\forall u_i \in \mathcal{U},\ 
sim(u, u_i) \geq sim(u, u_{i-1})$

Then the $K$-nearest neighbors is the sequence $\mathcal{S}_u = (u_n, u_{n-1}, ..., u_{n-K}), u_i \in \mathcal{U}$.

We can then see the _neighborhood of $u$_ as describing a _usage group_, that is to say: a group of users all being
representative of a given sort of _usage_ of the search engine. Said another way, we could also consider such users as a
_category of users_. But a given group is relative to a given user $u$, so $\mathcal{S}_u$ is not "all the users
belonging to a given category", nor it is a "users clusters", it just is "a group of users with similar usage".

## Web Graph Nodes Personalization Score [persoscore]

Now that we have a _usage_ defined, we are going to score URLs of the web, web graph nodes, according to the usage
group of the current user, thus providing a personalized score.

We take the definition of the score based on similar user profiles from[#largescaleeval][], as follows:

$$score(u, q, p) = 
\cfrac
{ \sum\limits_{u_s \in \mathcal{S}_u}{\left( sim(u_s, u) \cdot |clicks(q, p, u_s)| \right)} }
{ \beta + \sum\limits_{u_s \in \mathcal{S}_u}{|clicks(q, \bullet, u_s)|} }$$

where $u$ is a given user, $q$ is a given query and $p$ is a given page from the SERP of the query $q$. $\beta$ is a 
smoothing factor that is equal to $0.5$ here.

This way, the more similar a user is to the current user, the more impact the usage of the other user has on current
user's own personalized score. Note that the usage of the user $u$ itself does not appear anymore here. It is taken into
account in the $sim()$ function and thus it impacts globally the computation, but the clicks data itself is coming from
the similar users, this is why we call this a _collaborative filtering_ approach: it uses the same principle as
recommender systems using _collaborative filtering_ algorithms.

<!-- \pagebreak -->

## PageRank Personalization [prpersomain]

### Recalls on PageRank Computation [prrecalls]

As presented [in the related work][relworkprpr], PageRank is a recursively defined ranking algorithm whose goal is to
provide a _absolute_ ordering to _all_ nodes of a _web graph_. It also has other applications and is not limited
to web graphs, but it was introduced in this purpose. We reviewed in [][relwork] how it is based on the _random
surfer model_ but did not go into the details of the PageRank computation. We will cover them now.

The basic idea of PageRank ranking system is that if page $u$ has a link to page $v$, then the author of $u$ thinks $v$
has some importance. $stackoverflow.com$, for instance, is intuitively an important page, considering the high number of
links from other nodes of the graph pointing to it. How does one determine the importance a page $u$ will give to a page
$v$? The most important the page $u$, the highest standard of contents and thus of links, is supposed to be on page $u$.
Thus, the higher the _importance_ $u$ has, the higher the importance it _transfers_ to page $v$ by linking to it. This
can be seen as an analogy of, indeed, academic citation ranking: if a paper is cited by a very important paper, it gains
more importance than if it is cited by a newly released paper that has not proved to be very important yet (by being
cited  itself too). The (simplified) definition of the transfer of importance between $u$ and $v$ can be seen as
follows[#tspr][]:

$$\forall v, Rank^{(i+1)}(v) = \sum_{u \in \mathcal{B}_v}{\cfrac{Rank^{(i)}(u)}{N_u}}$$

where $v, u$ are pages (web graph nodes), $\mathcal{B}_v$ is the set of _backlinks_ of $v$, that is to say the set of
other pages that are linking to $v$ and $N_u$ is the number of _outlinks_ of $u$, also called _outedges_ for _outgoing
edges_ (remember the web graph is a _directed_ graph).

<!-- \pagebreak -->

Notice that in practice, the latter formula is expressed with a damping factor $c < 1$ that is used to balance the fact
that there are nodes with no outgoing edges and their _importance_ (also called _weight_ later on) is lost from the
system[#PR98][]:

$$\forall v, Rank^{(i+1)}(v) = c \cdot \sum_{u \in \mathcal{B}_v}{\cfrac{Rank^{(i)}(u)}{N_u}}$$

[#PR98][] also explains that the starting set of values $\forall u, Rank^{(0)}(u)}$ does not impact the stabilized
values, but it does impact the number of iterations the computation will take. As a consequence, "updating" a PageRank
vector should be much faster than computing it for the first time. The values of the weights will indeed already be
quite close to their real value, thus reducing significantly the number of required iteration. This makes PageRank a
good candidate for web graph applications as typical web crawlers never stop crawling and are always updating the link
database (as there is no real _end of the crawl_ as the web likely expands faster than what you can crawl).

The previous formula is used for every node of the web graph and we repeat/iterate it until the ranks converge to stable
values[#tspr][].

But the way PageRank computation is generally handled is using matrices. 
Let $M = ((m_{uv})), (u,v) \in [[0, N-1]]$ be the _links matrix_, $N$ being the total number of nodes
in the web graph. Let $m_{uv} = \cfrac{1}{N_v}$ if there is a link from $u$ to $v$, $m_{uv} = 0$ else.
Now let $R = \begin{pmatrix}w_0\\ \vdots\\ w_n\end{pmatrix}$ be the _PageRank vector_ where $w_u$ is the PageRank score
for page $u$.

Then, we can write the previous formula for all web pages at once by writing, in matrix notation:

$$R = c M R$$

This equation means that $R$ is an eigen vector of $M$ with eigenvalue $c$. More specifically, PageRank uses the
dominant eigenvalue of $M$[#PR98][], which can be computed by repeatedly applying $M$ to any nondegenerate starting $R$
vector, which confirms the previous characteristics about $R$ starting values not impacting the final PageRank scores.

If the web were a fully connected directed graph, we could stop here. But a pattern in the web graph causes a problem:
What  happens when two pages $u$ and $v$ link _only_ to each other. Now consider there is a third page $p$ that links to
one of  them. This is what the  authors called a _rank sink_: indeed, the "rank", or importance ranking, will be
transferred to $u$ and $v$ through $p$ but they will never redistribute what has been transferred to them, they will
simply  continue mutually grow their own rank without diluting it to the rest of the graph. This is problematic because
the global  "importance" should transfer ad-hoc to all the nodes of the graph at every iteration.

To overcome this problem, the original authors introduce what they call the "rank source" vector $E$.

The first presented equation becomes as follows:

$$\forall v, Rank^{(i+1)}(v) = c \cdot \left( \sum_{u \in \mathcal{B}_v}{\left(\cfrac{Rank^{(i)}(u)}{N_u}\right)} + E(u) \right)$$

This "rank source" vector will basically ensure that at every iteration every node of the graph will indeed receive a
minimal amount of rank. The $E(u)$ function is originally a constant function of value $\forall u, E(u) = \cfrac{1}{N}$ with 
$N$ the number of nodes in the graph.

The matrix notation becomes:

$$R = c (M + E) R$$

<!-- \pagebreak -->

### The PageRank "Personalization Vector" [prpersovect]

We just defined that PageRank computation can be summarized as the following equation, in matrix notation:

$$R = c (M + E) R$$

where $R$ is the _PageRank vector_ that holds all the PageRank scores for all the web pages of the graph, $M$ is the
_links matrix_, that holds the linking information from and to every page in the graph, and $E$ is the "source of rank"
vector.

This is where it starts being interesting for us: The $E$ vector is also called _personalization vector_ by the authors.
Indeed, when $E()$ is a constant function, $E$ vector simply adds, in terms of the _random surfer model_ (presented in
[][relworkprpr]) a uniform probability to all nodes that the surfer will randomly jump to them.

But what happens if we decide $E()$ not to be constant anymore? Then we are _biasing_ the computation of the PageRank
towards certain nodes compared to others, because we are increasing the probability to randomly jump to those nodes
at every iteration of the PageRank computation.

Note that the fact we are adding a little more chances to jump to those nodes at _every_ iteration means this is not
doable by simply post-processing the result of the PageRank, it needs to actually be done during the PageRank
computation, which  makes this technique quite expensive.

Using the $E$ _personalization vector_ is not something new that we are introducing here. It is not even something
theoretical that has never been applied in the past: both the original work[][#PR98] and the latter "topic-
sensitive"[#tspr][] version have applied this technique with success, which gives us a strong basis for our work.
In[#PR98][] the authors simply ran a test of Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation by setting the home page of a
researcher has the only node in the graph that had a non-null weight in the personalization vector. The result was
immediate: the ranking completely changed and the top-ranked links were now links that were directly linked from the
home  page of the researcher and thus, supposed to be strongly related to the researcher's interest. As a
consequence, the  authors originally suggested that this could for instance be used by setting the personalization
vector with non-null weights only on the URLs that would be in the user's bookmarks. The issue with this is, as we
previously discussed, that users do not want to provide information by themselves, so we have to infer it, which is what
we are doing in this work.

In the second work on PPR[#tspr][] the authors used a different approach about how to generate this personalized
version of $E$.

As said [earlier][relworktspr], they divided the entire web into 16 categories, taken from the ODP[#ODP][]. Then, they
generated a PPR vector for each of those 16 categories. The $E$ vector, for every category $\mathcal{C}$, is set as
follows:

$$E(\mathcal{C}) = \begin{pmatrix}p_0\\ \vdots\\ p_u\\ \vdots\\ p_n\end{pmatrix},
p_u = \begin{cases}
\cfrac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|} & u \in \mathcal{C}\\
0 & u \notin \mathcal{C}\\
\end{cases}$$

where $p_u$ represents the coordinate of the vector for the web page $u$ and $|\mathcal{C}|$ is the number of URLs in the 
category $\mathcal{C}$.

The issue is that it means we now have not _one_ personalization vector, but _a set_ of personalization vectors. We are
going to see in the next section how to combine them.

### Combination of PageRank vectors [prcombination]

The original work on PageRank[#PR98][] has not explored ways to actually combine different PageRank vectors into a
global vectors that would be composed of locally computed specificities. But the derived work[#tspr][] explored it. 

As in the case of[#tspr][], the same way they did for web pages, they used IR techniques to provide every request with a
specific probability to belong to one of their categories. They then use those probabilities as a weighting factor for
the related PPR vector, building the global PR vector as a linear combination of the "categorized" PR vectors:

$$R_{combined} = \sum_{\mathcal{C} \in \mathcal{T}}{P(\mathcal{C}|q)R(\mathcal{C})}$$

where $q$ is the current query, $\mathcal{T}$ is the set of all categories (16 in[#tspr][]), $R_c$ is the PPR vector
that  has been computed using the personalization vector $E(\mathcal{C})$ and $P(\mathcal{C}|q)$ is the probability that
query $q$ belongs to category $\mathcal{C}$, where[#tspr][] uses a formula that makes itself uses of scores computed by
a multinomial naive-Bayes classifier.

### Usage-based PageRank Personalization [cppr_vect]

In our work, we use a _personalization vector_ $E$ defined using the collaborative scores previously computed in
[][persoscore].

The $E$ vector is thus defined as follows:

$$E(q, u) = \begin{pmatrix}p_0\\ \vdots\\ p_i\\ \vdots\\ p_n\end{pmatrix},
p_i = \begin{cases}
\cfrac{1}{N} & i \notin clicks(\mathcal{S}_u, \bullet, \bullet) \\
score(u, q, i) & i \in  clicks(\mathcal{S}_u, \bullet, \bullet) \\
\end{cases}$$

where $u$ is the current user, $q$ is the current query and $i$ represents a page. The $score()$ function is the one we 
defined in [][persoscore] and $N$ is, as in previous equations, the total number of nodes in the web graph.

As the scores being used in $E$ have already been computed collaboratively, the _collaboratively personalized PageRank vector_ 
$CPPR(q, u)$ can be defined as the PageRank vector computed using the personalization vector $E(q, u)$. This means the 
original PageRank equation, as presented in [][prrecalls] becomes:

$$CPPR(q, u) = c (M + E(q, u)) CPPR(q, u)$$

The $CPPR(q, u)$ vector is the personalized PR vector we are going to use in our [experimentation][expe]. 

<!-- \pagebreak -->

Nevertheless, let us still have a look at what we would obtain if we were to apply the technique of [weighted linear
combination of PR vectors][prcombination] to our work. It would give the following:

$$CCPPR(u, q) = \sum_{u_s \in \mathcal{S}_u}{sim(u, u_s)CPPR(u_s, q)}$$

where $S_u$ is the [previously defined][usageextraction] set of $K$-nearest neighbors of $u$ and $CPPR(u_s)$ is the
CPPR vector as previously defined. In this current case, such a technique would mean that we not only use the similar
users to the current user, but we also use the users similar to the earlier similar users. Indeed, $u_s$ here is a user
similar to $u$, but $CPPR(u_s, q)$ is then computed using the personalization scores that take into account the users
similar to $u_s$. This would thus integrate even more collaborative information.

However, in the current work, we are going to limit the _collaboration_ to the CPPR vector level. We let the experimentation 
of a two-level collaboration (CCPPR) to [future work][ccppr_futurework].

# Experimentation: Implementation <!-- \\ --> & <!-- \\ --> Evaluation [expe]

## Introduction

In this part of the work, we are going to present in details the evaluation and the experimentation that we performed on
the proposed algorithm and personalization system. We will put an emphasis on results being reproducible as a personal
choice as we believe a lot of published works are either experimented and/or evaluated on proprietary datasets or are
missing crucial information that prevents reproduction of the results. Our entire implementation is also available
online[#githubcode][].

[][expe] is going to be organized as follows: 

- First, we will present in details the openly available dataset that we chose to use. We will present its
characteristics and some statistics about it, allowing for comparison with earlier/later works' datasets.

- Second, we will explain in [][neededinfo] why we chose this dataset as the best candidate for our evaluation. We will
also explain why the dataset is still not perfect and will present the "enrichment" (post-processing) process we choose
to approximate missing information.

- The third section will cover the tools and models we used in terms of web search. How we generate the web graph that
we are using to compute PageRank and how we store it and search it using standard IR tools.

- The fourth section will detail the PageRank computation, explaining how the heavy computation implied by the formulas
presented in [][cpprmain] is carried on.

- The last section of this part will present the evaluation measures themselves, the methodology and the results that
we obtained with this methodology.

## AOL Search Logs [aollogs]

The dataset we used to run our experiments is the AOL Search Logs that were released in 2006 under a 
non-commercial/academic license.
These logs consist of 21,011,340 queries collected from 657,426 users over a 3-month time interval[#picturesearch][].
According to comScore Media Metrix, the AOL search network had 42.7 million unique visitors in May 2006, so the total
data set covered roughly 1.5% of May 2006 search users for instance. The queries are also only taken from the ones that
were issued through the _AOL Client_, meaning that the "user id" information is reliable. Indeed, it is based on users
being  authenticated and not based on cookies, which could lead to wrongly assigned ids or to the loss of an id in the
middle of a search session. According to the dataset's original description[^aolreadme], the queries are entirely
unfiltered and revealed in plain text in the logs, which makes it a perfect candidate for personalization. The fact that
the logs are _unfiltered_ also means that most of the top queries are about subjects like sex or pornography, though,
which makes a pre-processing necessary in case of users study, as we will see later.

### Clicks Distribution

#### Of Users

As we can see in [](#clicksdistrib) (where both axis' scales are logarithmic), the number of users for a given number of
clicks first has a sharp exponential decrease in the beginning and tends to something more linear towards the end. This
can also be seen in [](#clicksdistrib2) where we can also remark that 50% of the users have less than 11 clicks.

This could seem to mean that users mainly have very few information to give in terms of clicks to be included in their
_user profile_, but in the end the average number of clicks per user if about 37, which already gives a reasonable
amount of information.

It is worth noting that the dataset does not include any user with an empty profile. All users of the dataset have at
least one click.

<!-- 
\vspace{5\baselineskip}

#### Of Queries

The distribution of clicks per query string is shown in [](#clicksdistrib3). We clearly see that it also accuses a sharp
exponential decrease, but this time, stays mostly stable.

![Clicks Distribution: Queries with a given number of clicks][clicksdistrib3]

[clicksdistrib3]: aol_logs_clicks_distribution_on_queries.png

It is interesting to remark that about $48\%$ of queries have only one click. And only 5% of queries have more than $10$
clicks, as shown in [](#clicksdistrib4).

![Clicks Distribution: Percentage queries with more than X clicks][clicksdistrib4]

[clicksdistrib4]: aol_logs_clicks_distribution_on_queries_percentage.png

The same way the dataset does not include any user with no clicks, we can see here that it also does not include any
query with no clicks. AOL originally explained that the dataset was basically the dump of an internal database which
itself was only a small sample of their search engine queries on the same period, but did not provide much information
on how the sampling was done. Either AOL researchers database was originally sampled in purpose with only queries and
users with clicks, or the researchers, which at that time released the logs with clicks analysis in mind, decided to
filter out the queries or users that had no clickthrough information.


### Queries Per User and Clicks Average Distribution 

The queries frequency distribution, that can be seen in [](#queriesdistrib1) and [](#queriesdistrib2) seem to follow
roughly the same rules as the two previous distributions that we  plotted. It is interesting as this probably means that
the users have a consistent behavior: They click a lot because they query a lot, not only because they always query
the same thing and click on all the links.

This assumption is confirmed by [](#clicksavgdistrib1) that shows the average number of clicks per query distribution
over the users. Furthermore, we grouped users into intervals of average numbers of clicks per query in
[](#clicksavgdistrib_histo) and, as we can see, $99\%$ of users have between $0$ and $10$ clicks in average, per
queries. Which indeeds confirms that the clicks behavior of users is quite stable. As a matter of information, the
average of the _averages number of clicks per user_ over the entire dataset is $2.02$.

[clicksavgdistrib_histo]: aol_logs_avg_click_per_query_users_distribution_histogram_percentage_interval_10.png

### Click Entropy Distribution

In order to make comparisons easier, we decided to compute the click entropy with the same formula
as[#largescaleeval][], as follows:

$$ClickEntropy(q) = \sum\limits_{p \in \mathcal{P}(q)}{-P(p|q)\log_2(P(p|q))}$$

with $\mathcal{P}(q)$ the collection of web pages clicked for query $q$ and $P(p|q)$ as follows:

$$P(p|q) = \cfrac{|Clicks(q, p, \bullet)|}{|Clicks(q, \bullet, \bullet)|}$$

If we simply look at the graph of the queries distribution in terms of click entropy by taking entropy values
floored at 2 digits, it is a little bit hard to see anything, as shown in [](#clickentropychaotic).

![Click Entropy: Number Of Queries As A Function Of Click Entropy Score][clickentropychaotic]

[clickentropychaotic]: click_entropy_distribution_chaotic.png

However, we get a much better picture if we group them by interval of 1, for instance, as shown in
[](#clickentropy_histogram).

![Click Entropy: Number Of Queries As Grouped By Click Entropy Score][clickentropy_histogram]

[clickentropy_histogram]: click_entropy_distribution_on_queries.png

We also decided to plot the same graphs as the ones presented in[#largescaleeval][]. That way, we believe we make it
easier to compare both evaluations (and both dataset). [](#thisisatrick) shows the plot on our dataset on the left and
the plot from[#largescaleeval][] on the right.

![Click Entropy: Number Of Queries Grouped By Click Entropy Score][clickentropy_comparison]
![Click Entropy: Number Of Queries Grouped By Click Entropy Score (from[#largescaleeval][])][clickentropy_comparison_previouswork]

[clickentropy_comparison_previouswork]: click_entropy_distribution_comparison_previous_work.png width=200px
[thisisatrick]: this_is_a_trick_to_display_a_figure_caption_under_the_two_previous_images


We can see here that distributions are quite different in some points. They both have a much higher percentage of
queries with click entropy between $0$ and $0.5$, but inversed patterns for the next two intervals.

Starting at $2.0$, though, both graph show a very similar pattern.

### Clicked Items Ranks [itemsrank] 

It is generally believed that clicks are mainly made on the first page and especially on the top results.

We decided to plot the distribution of clicks for every _item rank_ from the logs in order to see how it applies to our
dataset.

[](#clicksperrankfig) shows that what is believed is fully true: First, the first page has an order of magnitude higher
number of clicks, and the first item of the first page even higher. Also, on most pages (ranks from $1$ to $10$ and then
$10^x+1$ to $10^{x+1}$, $\forall x > 0$), we see a much higher number of clicks for the first item of the page. It is
often (but not always, as we will detail below) much higher than any other result on the same page, and then we see an
exponential decrease until the end of the page. There is also a very sharp decrease after the first page, and
[](#itemsrankfig) shows that the $9^{th}$ item is the limit where the slope of the curve changes, thus meaning that the
the decrease in clicks is very sharp between the $1^{st}$ and the $9^{th}$ item but then decreases slower.

Although one might think at first that on [](#clicksperrankfig) the patterns that we see show a constant decrease on
every page and then the first item of the next page has more clicks than the last item of the previous page, it is in
fact not always the case and quite often the last item of a page has much more clicks than the $9^{th}$ or $8^{th}$ on
the same page. The item $25^{th}$ for instance, also has much more clicks than any other item on the second page, and
the same goes for the $45^{th}$ item. We double checked our calculation in order to be sure it was not a bug on our
side, but it seems the click behavior is just not constant over the 50 first pages.

The average item rank, weighted by the number of clicks, and over the entire set of clicks, of the dataset, is $6.89$.

## AOL Logs Enrichment

### Introduction

In this section, we are going to present how we placed ourselves in terms of use of the information contained
specifically in the AOL Search Logs presented earlier. We are going to present the differences between what is needed in
terms of information for our approach and what the dataset provides and present the technique we used to _enrich_ the
dataset with an approximation of the missing information.

### Needed Information [neededinfo]

While most re-ranking techniques (collaborative filtering, learning to rank) use the _current_ ranking of the search
engine and the _clickthrough_ information, thus mainly working on the data from the dataset, our approach is based on
using the _web graph_ as a means of re-ranking. The needed information is thus scores to apply directly to the _web
graph nodes_. Very few datasets out there provide enough information for a proper evaluation to be made. For instance,
the Yandex dataset[#yandex][], while one of the most recent in search engines clickthrough datasets, is fully
anonymized. Keywords, and more importantly, clicked URLs, are entirely replaced by unique identifiers. While one could
try to perform statistical attacks on the dataset to try to deanonymize it, it is both against the terms of use of the
dataset and also completely out of the scope of this thesis. Other datasets generally do not include URLs either.
Sogou[#sogou][] dataset does include them but the queries are mainly in Chinese, and we would need a board of users
speaking Chinese in order to evaluate queries from this dataset, which is this time simply out of reach for us. As a
consequence, the AOL dataset is the one that provides the closest information to what we need, if we were to summarize,
this is the list of the needed information:

[#sogou]: "Sogou laboratory data download - user query logs", http://www.sogou.com/labs/dl/q.html, last visited 14 Sept. 2014
[#yandex]: "Data - Personalized Web Search Challenge | Kaggle", http://www.kaggle.com/c/yandex-personalized-web-search-challenge/data, last visited 14 Sept. 2014

- A unique way to identify users (id)
- A unique way to identify queries (id or query string)
- A unique way to identify clicked results/links (id or URL)

- Either search queries keywords (to be able to issue the query again) or the complete SERP ranking at the time of the
logs.  
This is to allow an evaluation to be performed. If we have the keywords, we can do a user study-based evaluation. If we
have the original complete ranking of every query, we can do an automated evaluation using a measure like NDCG[#ndcg][],
using the clickthrough data as a means of "relevancy" grading. This has been done in[#kagchallenge][]. But these methods
are inherently biased towards the set of top queries originally returned by the search
engine[#largescaleeval][][#longshortclicks][].

- URLs that have been clicked by the users  
This part is very important because if we do not have URLs, then we cannot map the clicked result to a node of the graph
and we cannot provide personalized web graph nodes weights to the PageRank algorithm.

Now what does the AOL Search Logs provide us with, in terms of information?

- A unique way to identify users (user id)
- A unique way to identify queries (complete query string)
- The date and time of every action recorded in the logs
- A non-unique way to identify clicked results: the clicked URL __domain__ and its _position_ in the SERP.

The last bullet is where additional work is needed: The data in the logs is not entirely ready for us to be used. Only
_domains_ are provided. In addition to the domain, the original ranking (position in the SERP) of the clicked domain
is provided, which allows us to differentiate, for the same query between two clicked domains, if they were not at the
same position, as the search engine did not display twice the same URL (while it could have displayed several times the 
same domain (with some limit, depending on the search engine)).

As a consequence, we have an additional task here, before being able to use the dataset: we need to find a way to recover,
as precisely as possible, the original URL, to be able to map its clicks to a web graph node.

### Approximating Missing Information

What we decide to do in order to make up for the lack of unique and complete URLs is to map the clicks of a given
$(domain, position)$ pair from the 2006 logs, to a _similarly ranked_ $(domain, position)$ pair in the SERP that can be
found by users _today_, a couple of years later (details about "_similarly ranked_" in [][urlremapping]). We considered
this option as the most likely to bring an equal semantic information as what could have been achieved at the time the
logs were released. Indeed, while the web has evolved, some queries still are returning a lot of websites in common. If
you were querying for an official US government form in 2006 for instance, if you query it today, it is very likely that
the same page, of the same government website, will appear in the results.

As a consequence, we decide that we will only keep the information from the logs, that corresponds to queries that still
have at least one domain in common in the 2014 SERP compared to the 2006 SERP.

We did this by re-issuing a pre-selected set of queries on the AOL search engine, and comparing the results of the first 
page returned. The re-querying system is explained in the next section.

### AOL Re-querying System [serprequery]

The AOL search engine does not provide a direct API to issue queries and get results back. The only way is the "user
way".

As a consequence, we simply write a script that queries the search engine like any _new_ user would. We do not store
cookies between sessions to insure that no kinds of personalization can be done. The fact that the consecutive queries
have in general nothing to do with each other also probably prevents the search engine from performing  personalization.
Moreover, we also query the search engine from different IPs. Altogether, we randomly select a number of queries that we
also issue by hand to check that the results were the same as the ones the scripts retrieved, and they were no evidences
of any difference between what the script is able to return and what a human being would get in terms of results from
the AOL Search Engine.

The system can be set up to crawl a given number of SERPs for each query (1 SERP = only the first page, 2 = first &
second,  etc.). For the current experiment, we proceed as follows: 

We run it for "targeted" queries, the ones that were chosen to be part of the user study (see [][selectedqueries]).
Those queries are re-issued until the $50^{th}$ SERP, as the logs included clicks up to the position $500$, in other
words, for the $50$ first SERPs. We can do this because the number of queries to re-issue here is small.


## Web Search models and tools [webtools]

### Web Crawl [webcrawl]

In order to be able to run the PageRank, we need a web graph. Over time, there have been numerous interesting projects
aiming at providing open web crawl datasets for research. Among them we can cite[#webgraphuk][] which have put together
an impressive amount of datasets, or the Stanford WebBase[#webbase][] that has been used in famous PageRank works in the
past such as[#PR98][] and[#tspr][] but also many others. The most complete and recent one is probably[#commoncrawl][]
that is made available through the Amazon S3 services for convenience[#amazoncrawl][] but can also be obtained
standalone.

Another web crawl worth noting is the Web Archives Association's one, which can be obtained upon
request[#webarchives][]. For completeness, we will not forget to also reference the _Lemur Project_[#lemur][] that has
been already used in the IR field through different works in the past.

Although it seems at first that there are plenty of different web crawls available openly on the Internet, it is not as 
easy as it seems to use them.

Indeed,[#commoncrawl][] for instance, represented in its 2012 version over 100TB of uncompressed data. Similarly, most
of those datasets are either of unmanageable sizes if not run on some sort of distributed architecture, or are simply
focused web crawls (like[#webgraphuk][]) that will not necessarily include the web pages that are referenced from the
logs. Also, except one or two maintained projects, the web crawls are also relatively old. Moreover, some of them only
include the graph and not the actual data of the web pages, and thus we would not be able to run an IR request against
them.

As a consequence of these drawbacks, we decide to give a try to write our own web crawler and create our own focused
web crawl around a set of links extracted from a set of queries that we want to study in the context of the
experimentation and evaluation of our research work. Having experience with the _Scrapy_[#scrapy][] framework to build
web crawlers, it is quick enough to build our own one.

The advantage of building our own one is also that we will be able to give it the behavior we want. For instance, we
might prefer crawling many different websites compared to crawling all pages of a given website, as we are interested in
PageRank computation afterwards and as the data we have from the logs is per domain.

[#scrapy]: "Scrapy | An open source web scraping framework for Python", Scrapy Project, http://scrapy.org, last visited 14 Sept. 2014

Our web crawler behaves and is configured as follows:

- It starts from a URLs seed list (seed generation will be described later).

- It crawls up to a depth of 5. "Depth" represents the number of consecutive links we followed since the seed URL + 1
($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C$, $C$ is at depth $3$).

- It follows only links that are less than 255 characters long.

- It does not crawl a list of predefined patterns (cgi, images, ...) including the most common authentication systems
like Google/Facebook/Microsoft authentications systems.

- It processes links in the order of the HTML code.

- It gives priority to a "broad" crawl (many different websites/domains), compared to crawling all pages of a website:

    + It follows at most 3 links to the same domain, per page.
    
    + It follows at most 7 links to domains different from current one, per page.

- It does not follow redirections (301, 302).

- It obeys the `robots.txt` directives.

- It waits at maximum 60 seconds to download a page.

- It may retry up to twice to download a given web page.

- It processes at most 500 request in parallel.

- It does not store nor sends back cookies.

- It performs at most 8 concurrent queries to the same domain.

- It waits 1 second between queries to the same domain.

Such settings/rules are a combination of what we want to achieve and "best practices" for fast broad web crawls we
have found when searching.

We run 3 instances of the web crawler in parallel, with different parts of the URLs seed list, in order to take
advantages of all the CPUs of the server.

The URLs seed was generated by taking the 500 first links returned by the 2014 AOL Search Engine for the queries that
were selected.

The selected queries are defined in [][selectedqueries].


### Information Retrieval models and tools [irtools]

#### Introduction

In this section we are going to present the different tools and models we used in terms of Information Retrieval.
Although this thesis is not focused on IR techniques but rather on a non-IR technique that is used in addition to IR
techniques in web search to improve the results, we still need to use IR tools as part of our experimentation if we want
to rebuild search-engine-like system. This section is going to first present what kind of "search engine" we are
building. Then, it will present the tools that we used (ElasticSearch) and how we configured it. Next, we will explain
the details of how we indexed the previously described web crawl in the search engine, especially the pre-indexing
processing. We will finally briefly explain how we query the search engine in order to give all the necessary details
for our work to be reproducible. 

#### Web Search Engine [webseexplanations]

In order to reproduce the real-world process in which our proposed PageRank personalization technique would be used we
needed to somehow build a "web search engine". Needless to say that one does not simply build a concurrent to Google in
a matter of months. So, our _search engine_ is not anywhere near Google in terms of both quality of results (which also
mostly comes from the web crawl quality) and completeness and speed. The goal of this _search engine_ is to allow us to
make an information retrieval query on the web crawl we created. Once this query returns results, we want to then apply
both standard PageRank and CPPR scores to the set of results and display the rankings combining scoring from both IR
and PageRank, the same way it has been done in[#PR98][] and[#tspr][].

A simplified view of the setup we want to achieve is presented in [](#web_se_simple_diagram).

![Simplified Web Search Engine Setup][web_se_simple_diagram]

[web_se_simple_diagram]: search_engine_web_crawl_simple_diagram.png

##### ElasticSearch & BM25 [eschoices]

The criteria for the tool to be chosen as our _search engine_ were the following: 

<!--
% Using LateX here to specify the noitemsep and save the iota of space necessary no to have 2 additional pages
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item It has to run as a standalone application
\item It has to be queried easily
\item It has to provide an easy indexing API
\item It has to provide the state-of-the-art in terms of IR techniques, more specifically: BM25.
\end{itemize}
-->

In terms of open source software for information retrieval, several options came to us.

First, the IR Framework Terrier[#terrierir][] seemed to be an interesting candidate. But having previous experience with
it, we knew it is not straightforward to add new features to Terrier, especially if they do not only rely on standard
indexing techniques. Also, we wanted a solution that could be queried easily through an API, well documented and if
possible widely used so that it has proven to be stable.

Then of course came to mind the IR library Lucene[#luceneir][] from the Apache Foundation. Lucene is an interesting
candidate but it is a _library_, not a full-blown search engine. We would have had to develop again some parts of the
search engine. Moreover, Lucene has no built-in scalability features and we did not know yet if indexing between half a
million and a million documents would require much resources or not.

Built based on Lucene, the two main projects that we had to choose from in the end were Apache Solr[#solr][] and
ElasticSearch[#es][]. Solr had the advantage of being integrated with the Nutch[#nutch][] project that basically is
a web search engine, including crawling and indexing.

However, Nutch has in our opinion one of the worst documentation one could find. It also appeared that Solr did not
scale very well as of the reviews we could find. Moreover, ElasticSearch offered the option to use the Lucene's BM25
implementation easily and provided an API based on JSON, which fulfilled our criteria.

Having previous experiences with ElasticSearch, it appeared as the best option as the documentation is much more
complete. It also is probably the currently most recognized and stable open source deploy-your-own-one IR search engine
as of this writing.

The details of the indexing configuration of ElasticSearch will be given in the next section.

<!-- \pagebreak -->

##### Indexing: Pre-processing and indexing settings [esindexing]

First of all, we configure ElasticSearch as follows, to index the web crawl:

- 4 shards, in case we need to scale to multiple servers
- 0 replicas

The exact configuration follows:

<!-- \begin{scriptsize} -->
    http.max_content_length: 500mb
    index.store.compress.stored: true
    index.store.compress.tv: true
    index.cache.field.max_size: 50000
    index.cache.field.expire: 10m
<!-- \end{scriptsize} -->

We then create a _mapping_ to store the data about each web page, as follows:

<!-- \begin{scriptsize} -->

    doc_type: {
      "_all" : {"enabled" : "false"},
      "_source" : {"enabled" : "false"},
      "_id": {"store": "true"},
      'properties': {        
          'url': {
            'type': 'string',
            "store": "true",
            'index': 'not_analyzed'
          },
          'title': {
            'type': 'string',
            'similarity': 'BM25',
            "store": "true"
          },
          'content': {
            'type': 'string',
            'similarity': 'BM25',
            "store": "true"
          },
          'description': {
            'type': 'string',
            'similarity': 'BM25',
            "store": "true"
          }
      }
    }

<!-- \end{scriptsize} -->

<!-- \pagebreak -->

This mapping is composed of the following main components:

- It indexes the title, the content of the web page and its description using BM25. Indeed, this is what we are
susceptible to use when querying the search engine. We did not know yet if we were going to only use the content of the 
page or not. This would depend on how the results would be.

- It does not store the `_all` field. Indeed, this would replicate all fields combined into one main one, and double the
index size, which is totally useless for us.

- It also stores the URL string, that will be displayed when showing the results and also to allow visiting the link if
the title and the descriptions are not enough to guess correctly the content of the web page.

- It stores the `_id` field "as a field", this `_id` field is going to be assigned directly by us (rather than letting
ES choose a unique id) to the unique integer that has been assigned to every URL during the web crawl. We thus want to
retrieve it as we will need the URL unique identifier in order to apply the personalization. To retrieve it, it need to
be stored "as a field".

Once ElasticSearch is set up, the indexing process goes as follows:

- Load the entire web graph as crawled.

- For every unique link in the graph, try to load the GZipped downloaded web page from the disk.

- If no such file exists, then this web page was on the border of the crawl (and thus not crawled) or it had not been
downloaded for other reasons (the server did not respond, refused crawlers, sent a wrong HTTP code... or it was excluded
by the robots.txt file).

- If such file exists, load its content, _process it_ and store it in memory up to a given batch size.

- When a batch is ready to be committed, send the batch to ElasticSearch.

<!-- \pagebreak -->

The _process_ we apply to the content of the web page is the following:

- First, we try to guess its encoding using the library _BeautifulSoup4_[#bs4][], which is a renowned library for HTML
parsing (including faults-robustness/invalid HTML robustness).

- If BeautifulSoup4 was not able to guess the encoding, we try the most common encodings (utf-8, latin1, latin9,
windows-latin1).

- If still no proper encodings are found, we use the library _Chardet_[#chardet][] that is specialized in guessing
encodings from text data.

- In case nothing is found we force conversion into UTF8 and remove the incompatible characters.

- Once the encoding has been guessed, we process the document HTML data with BeautifulSoup4 as follows:

    + We extract the `<title>` tag if any, and use this as the `title` field (cf. [ES Mapping][esindexing]) of the web page.
    + If no `<title>` tags are found, we look for the first `<h1>` tag in the HTML and use this as the `title` field.
    + In case there also are no `<h1>` tags, we assign "Untitled" as the document `title`.
    + We look for the `<meta>` tag with `name="description"` and store it in the `description` field if found.
    + We remove comments.

The indexing process turns out to be quite slow. Running it on 1 CPU on a server with not very good I/O performances ran
at a pace of $1.6$ indexed pages per second. On a server with better I/O performances, we could go up to $4.5$
pages/second.

As a consequence, in order to index the final web crawl of a million web pages in less than 30 hours, we ran several
workers on several servers, all committing to a central ElasticSearch server as shown in [](#indexing_process_diag).

##### Querying [esquery]

ElasticSearch provides multiple ways to _query_ its indexes. Depending on the way indexes are queried, results might
change.

For instance, it is possible to query without specifying a field, in this case ElasticSearch will give more importance
to fields that are shorter.

In order for our work to be reproducible, we provide here the syntax, using the _ElasticSearch Query DSL_, we used
in order to make a query to ElasticSearch:

    {
        'query': {
            'match': {
                'content': "the query string"
            }
        }
    }

In addition to that, we asked ElasticSearch to return the fields `_id`, `_score`, `url`, `title` and `description`. But
the syntax for this is specific to the Python driver we used and we will thus not provide it here.

The `_score` field is the matching score of each document against the query string, as far as we know it is directly 
coming from the Lucene engine used under the hood by ElasticSearch.

## 2006-to-2014 URLs Mapping [urlremapping]

The analysis of AOL [2006 logs][aollogs] using the technique presented in section [][usagemining] brings us a set
of $(user,\ query,\ domain,\ score)$ personalization tuples.

However, three issues arise with this:

1. The score is global to a _domain_, which might not be precise enough depending on the query.

2. Domains in the logs date from 2006 and the web graph we are going to generate by crawling the web will be from 2014.

3. The CPPR vectors presented in [][cppr_vect] are using URLs from the web graph we actually work on. The one we crawled
using the crawler defined in [][webcrawl]. Those are full URLs, not just domains.

Thus, we need to create a mapping $URL\ in\ 2014 \rightarrow domain\ from\ 2006\ logs$.

One could think we could simply reduce the 2014 URLs to their domain part and the mapping would be over. However, this
rises the following issue: A URL $A$, belonging to domain $B$, could be assigned some clicks (and thus weights) for
query $q1$ and $q2$ that both reference domain $B$ in the logs while in fact those two queries are quite different
and the pages, even from the same domain, that appeared in the AOL SERP in 2006 were probably different.

As a consequence, we need to build a more specific mapping, namely, we need to build a mapping $(query,\ URL2014)
\rightarrow (query,\ domain2006)$.

But how do we know if URL $u$ from the 2014 web crawl should belong to query $q1$ or $q2$ for instance?

What we decide to do it to use the AOL 2014 SERPs and AOL 2006 SERPs as a way to generate this mapping.

What we do is the following, for every targeted query:

- We take every URL clicked from the logs.

- We load all the URLs that were returned in the 2014 SERPs when re-querying the AOL Search Engine (see [][serprequery]).

- We walk through the list of URLs in the order they appeared in the 2006 SERP:

    + For each one, we walk through the URLs from the 2014 SERP of this same query, __also in order of the SERP__.

    + If domains are the same, we create a mapping entry $(query, URL\ id) \rightarrow (query, domain\ id)$ and we
remove both entries (domain (2006), URL (2014)) from the lists so that they cannot be mapped again.

<!-- \pagebreak -->

The algorithm can be described in pseudo-code as follows:

<!-- 
\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{algorithm2e}
    \ForEach{$query$ in $set\_of\_targeted\_queries\ $}{
        \ForEach{$domain$ in $clicked\_urls\_from\_logs\_sorted(query)\ $}{
            \ForEach{url in 2014\_aol\_serps\_sorted(query)$\ $}{
                \If{extract\_domain(url) == domain}{
                    $mapping[(query, url)] \longleftarrow domain$\;

                    $remove\_first\_from\_logs(query, domain)$\;
                    
                    $remove\_from\_2014_serps(query, url)$\;
                }
            }
        }
    }
\end{algorithm2e}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

-->
<!-- 
% Original, readable (IMHO) pseudo code:
%    for each query in set_of_targeted_queries:
%        for each domain in clicked_urls_from_logs(query):
%            for each url in 2014_aol_serps(query):
%                if extract_domain(url) == domain:
%                    mapping[(query, url)] = domain
%                    remove_from_logs(query, domain)
%                    remove_from_2014_serps(query, url)
%
-->

Where $remove\_first\_from\_logs(query, domain)$ will only remove the first (in the SERP order) entry of $domain$ for
the query $query$ and $clicked\_urls\_from\\\_logs\_sorted(query)$ and _2014_$\_aol\_serps\_sorted(query)$ respectively
return  the clicked domains and the URLs _in the order of the SERP_ (top-ranked item first).

<!-- \vspace{\baselineskip} -->

Then, once this mapping is in place, we need to run the formula from [][persoscore]: $score(u, q, p)$. We use it as
follows: $score(u, q, mapping[(q, p)])$ (recall: $q$ is the query, $u$ the user and $p$ the web page (url))

<!-- \vspace{\baselineskip} -->

If there are no mappings, the call to $mapping[(q, p)]$ returns a special value. The function $score()$ then returns the
standard score (uniform PageRank score, equal to $\cfrac{1}{|graph|}$) if this special value is passed as a parameter,
instead of returning the personalized score.

## PageRank Computation [prcompute]

### Choice Of The Library [prlibrary]

When it comes to actually implement PageRank computation, it seems obvious to us that this is an already widely solved
problem and we should not create our own implementation. Both because this would be wasted time and also because our
implementation would likely be less tested, reliable and even potentially optimized than long-proven libraries.

Among the library we have tried: JUNG (Java), Graph-Tool (Python, C++), iGraph (Python). But we have also studied many
others. As often with libraries, criteria of choices were: simplicity of use and of integration, completeness and
clearness of documentation, presence of tutorials, community support and performances. The required technical features
were: PageRank computation, exposure of the PageRank _personalization vector_ and input/output in widely used graph file
formats (such as GraphML).

Java-based libraries quickly showed that they did not fulfill the first goal. A quick test at JUNG took us to the
creation of half a dozen classes in order to read an XML file and transform it into a graph. We could not even imagine
how  complicated it would be to integrate with the entire project.

Graph-Tool, which seems to be currently maintained by a single developer, researcher in the German University of Bremen,
turned out to perfectly fulfill our needs. In terms of performances: it is written in C++ and provides very interesting
performances, it is built with OpenMP[#openmp][] support, which allows it to leverage the power of all available CPUs on
the host system. In terms of ease of use: the exposed API is very _pythonic_, that is to say that it respects the main
Python recommendations[#peps][], such as _there should be only one obvious way of doing things_[#peponeway][]. Moreover,
the rest of our project being in Python, the integration of Graph-Tool was literally straightforward. In terms of
features: It has built-in input/output in the standard GraphML format, with input/output being directly integrated  in
the library and done at the C++ level, making it hugely faster than loading the graph from Java or Python (and this
counts, when the graph has 17M nodes and 80M edges). The community support was also very good as the  bug tracker is very
active and the main developer timely to answer. We, by the way, thank Tiago de Paula Peixoto, the developer of the
library, for his incredible work and also for his responsiveness on the bugtracker.

When ran a couple of performances tests on Graph-Tool before settling with it. On a i7-4600U machine, we were able to
compute PageRank in about one second on graphs up to 500k nodes and 5M edges. At the time of performances tests, we
still had in mind the possibility of a real-time application and thus wanted to keep the computation time under one
second. Loading such a graph took about 15 seconds.

### From Web Graph to CPPR Pre-Computed Scores [cpprscore]

After running a couple of web crawls, we noticed that the number of edges in a web graph was way too high for us to keep
the  CPPR "application example" a real-time application. Moreover, as the user study and the evaluation are going to be
run on  a previously selected set of targeted queries, the need for a real-time $query \rightarrow results$ application
is inexistent. We thus decide to pre-compute the CPPR scores, using a targeted set of (query, user) pairs.

From the output of the [web crawler][webcrawl] to the pre-computed CPPR scores, the system can be described by the
diagrams shown in [](#web_crawl_to_graphml) and [](#graphml_to_cppr_scores).

[](#web_crawl_to_graphml) shows the post-processing that is necessary on the output of the multiple crawlers that were 
run in parallel until the generation of the final, merged graph that is usable by the Graph-Tool library.

[](#graphml_to_cppr_scores) shows the process of generating the CPPR scores. The input information is the previously
computed sets of top-similar users, clicks profiles, personalization scores and the web graph. And the output is the 
CPPR scores.

However, the final usage of such scores is going to be applied only on a subset of the URLs of our web graph. Indeed,
the  CPPR score is combined with the results of the [IR engine][irtools]. Thus, instead of storing millions of useless
scores in  database, what we do is that we only store the ones that are mapped to the IR engine output. This is
explained in more  details in [][finalranking].

[graphml_to_cppr_scores]: graphml_to_cppr_scores.png

### Final Rankings CPPR Scores [finalranking]

As [previously stated][cpprscore], storing directly the output of the CPPR computation would store millions CPPR values
for millions of URLs (all URLs of the web graph) while we in fact only need to store the ones that will actually be
used.

The ones that will actually be used are URLs that are returned by the [IR engine][irtools] for the set
of [targeted queries of the evaluation][selectedqueries]. As a consequence, we decide to directly generate the final
ranking, and to compute the CPPR values only as part of the process of generating the final rankings.

In order to do that, the system goes through the following steps:

1. It reads a list of (query_id, query_string, user_id) triples.

2. It queries ElasticSearch using the query_string and asks the 1,000 top results to be returned.

3. It loads the CPPR computation engine and initializes it with the necessary file paths and a connection to the DB (see
[](#web_crawl_to_graphml) and [](#graphml_to_cppr_scores) for the required input of the CPPR computation engine).

4. It asks the CPPR computation engine to first compute once the normal, non-personalized PageRank (will be used for the 
_baseline_ rankings).

5. Then, for each triple:

    1. It asks the CPPR engine to compute the CPPR vector on the entire graph.
    2. It keeps only the scores corresponding to the URLs IDs contained in the results returned by ElasticSearch.
    3. It stores in the DB the corresponding triple and the top 1,000 results together with their IR score and CPPR score.

This process is illustrated in [](#final_rankings_generation).

![Final Rankings Generation Process][final_rankings_generation]

[final_rankings_generation]: final_rankings_generation.png

You have probably noticed that no composite scores have been generated yet. This is because composite scores are
computed online. Computing composite scores online allow us to experiment with different rank merging algorithms. This
is discussed in [][rankmerging].

## Rank Merging & Post-Processing [rankmerging]

Rank merging is a research domain by itself. As a consequence, it is not feasible for us to review all rank merging
algorithms out there to see which one would perform best. The main reason for that is that if we really want to compare
them we would basically need to run a user study for each rank merging technique to see how well they perform in the
specific case of our application.

As a consequence, we decide to experiment with only two rank merging techniques: Multiplication of scores and Borda
Count.

While it may not seem like a "real" technique, multiplication of scores is what is done in[#tspr][] for instance but
also in the web search engine Nutch[#nutch][]. So we decide to give it a try, especially considering the
straightforwardness of implementing it.

On the other hand, Borda Count[#bordacount][], also called Borda Voting Scheme, is a technique that is commonly
attributed to the French mathematician Borda for his works during the $18^{th}$ century. It is used in some parts of the
world as a way to elect candidates during political elections. The details of the algorithm are not discussed here but
can be found online[#bordacountonline][] or in the literature[#bordacountbook][]. The reason we test Borda Count is
because it is the rank merging technique that was used in[#largescaleeval][] of which we already reuse the collaborative
click-based scoring approach and they had good results with it. Considering the fact that we use only a slight
modification of their scoring approach and their results with Borda, we consider it is an interesting option to
experiment with it.

As we do not have the possibility to run two user studies, we simply try to differentiate them by ourselves and ask the
opinion of two other people on cases where we can not decide easily.

It turns out that Borda Count and the multiplication of scores actually return extremely similar results and even often
the same results, at least for the top 10 results, that are going to be displayed to the users. In some cases, the
multiplication of scores seems to return more relevant results, thus we decide to keep it, as it is also the technique
used in[#tspr][] and in Nutch, precisely to merge the PageRank scores and the IR scores.

Thus, once the results are retrieved from the database, the composite score is computed by multiplying the IR score
and  the PageRank score. The PageRank score being the "normal" PageRank score for the _baseline_ ranking and CPPR score
for our personalized ranking. Once composite scores are assigned, items are sorted in descending order of composite
score.

Once all items are sorted, we display them with a limit of 2 items per domain in the final rankings. This limit has
several reasons: First, without setting a limit, the IR engine would generally have returned a very high number of
results  from the same domain, and the PageRank of the different pages on the domain is often quite similar. This is
because webmasters use strong self-linking strategies to mutually improve the PageRank of the web pages of their
websites. This is a problem Google dealt with a couple of years ago but Google only knows how they did it. Second, a
limit of results per domain set to 2 (or 3) is also what Google used to do until just recently (they seemed to have
changed it to a variable limit) and is what other modern web search engines do. As a consequence, we consider using such
a limit actually makes our rankings more similar to real-world search engines and as such, our evaluation closer to
real-world results that could be obtained in the industry.

## Overall Picture Of The Entire System

As the overall system is quite complex, we provide here a global picture of the CPPR personalization
system before diving  into the evaluation of the system. [](#overall_industry_example) shows an example of how the
system could be implemented for instance when integrated to an existing search engine, which would already have an IR
engine and a web graph in place and which would have the same URLs in its logs, IR and web graph engines.

On the other hand, [](#overall_experimental_setup) shows the experimental setup that we used in the current experiment.
As one can see, the required number of parts in the systems, and specifically of processes, is much higher. This comes
from the fact that the logs are not recent and coming from a web graph engine and web search engine that we do not have
control over and thus we need additional steps to rebuild the web graph and remap the URLs. The additional processes of
selecting the targeted queries and users for the experiment/evaluation are also not present in the case of the industry
example.

## Evaluation [evaluation]

In this section, we are going to present how we evaluated the performance of the experimental setup described in
[][expe] up to now.

### Methodology [methodology]

#### User Study Protocol [studyprotocol]

In order to make our work comparable, we decide to conduct the evaluation following a methodology in most points 
similar to the one conducted in the closest previous work to what we are doing, that is to say[#tspr][].

In[#tspr][], the authors choose 5 volunteers who are presented with 10 different queries and their results using both
the standard PageRank and the Topic-Sensitive PageRank. Volunteers are asked two things:

1. Select all results (links) that they think are relevant to the given query.
2. Give an overall preference for one of the two presented rankings.

Point 2. gives them the overall appreciation on whether their algorithm at least gives the impression to the user that 
results have been improved (which is an important point, as user satisfaction is the main goal of most systems).

Point 1. allows them to compute a _precision_ measure.[#tspr][] defines the _precision_ $p(q)$ for a query $q$ as
follows:

$$p(q) = \cfrac{|relevant\_results(q)|}{10}$$

with $relevant\_results(q)$ the set of results that are deemed _relevant_. A result is deemed  _relevant_ in[#tspr][] if
at least 3 of the 5 users marked it as relevant. The constant $10$ is the total number of results in the displayed
ranking.

The authors say that volunteers "were not told anything about how either of the ranking was generated".

<!-- \pagebreak -->

However, the authors do not specify:

- Whether the same ranking (left/right, or first/second displayed) was always the non-personalized and the personalized
one.  
This is important because the human brain, even on as few as 10 queries, can definitely develop a preference over the 
first or second ranking if for instance in the 3 first queries the second ranking was much better. The user will start
paying more attention to some details in one of the ranking and not in the other one, for instance.

- It is not entirely clear whether the users were only presented with raw "URLs" or with a snippet of the content, the
title of the page or not. But the text seems to say that they were only presented with raw URLs.

- Whether the users had the possibility to actually browse the web page corresponding to the URL in order to get a
glance at  what its actual content was or not. We believe users were simply supposed to _judge URLs_ which in our
opinion does not make enough sense as a URL could well often not be quite representative of the actual content of the
web page.

While the user study protocol had some imprecisions, the limits of their evaluation can also be found in the way they
present results. Indeed, in the case of the "preference" of one ranking compared to the other one for instance, they do
not publish the actual figures, but a rather fuzzy measure as "preferred by majority" for each query, as shown in
[](#tspr_eval_table). "Majority" not even being defined, but we guess that, for 5 volunteers, it means 3 volunteers, so
60%. However, one query is marked as having a preference "neither" for one ranking nor the other (see
[](#tspr_eval_table)). However, 50% is not achievable with 5 users, which means some information is missing in order to
fully know how their "preferred by majority" measure is calculated.

![Example of results of the Evaluation in[#tspr][]][tspr_eval_table]

[tspr_eval_table]: tspr_eval_preference.png width=250px height=175px

In our evaluation, we follow a similar protocol. We find 10 volunteers, and select 5 (queries, user) pairs. The latter
pairs are not completely randomly selected, the details about how queries are selected are presented in
[][selectedqueries].

<!-- \pagebreak -->

For every (query, user) pair, the volunteers are presented with the web UI shown in [](#user_study_web_ui), which
contains:

- A summary of previous topics the "user" queried before issuing this query.
- URLs (3 maximum) on which "similar users" have clicked in the past.
- Two rankings, one on the left and the other on the right, randomly swapped at every page reload. One is the baseline,
the other the CPPR ranking.
- Every ranking is composed of 10 "results". A "result" is presented the same way it is on a modern search engine:
    + The title of the page (title extraction details in [][esindexing]).
    + The URL of the page (clickable).
    + A snippet with the content of the `meta` "description" tag (see [][esindexing]) or "no description provided" if 
    the snippet is empty.

Volunteers are then asked to give the following judgments:

- Select "results" that they think are "relevant". With a maximum of 5 relevant results _per ranking_ and per query.
- Give an overall preference to one of the two rankings. Which one they think is the "best ranking overall".

![Example Page of the User Study Web UI][user_study_web_ui]

[user_study_web_ui]: user_study_web_ui.png

Volunteers do the user study on their own without any in-person advice, as they are all doing it remotely. A help
page is however displayed at the beginning of the user study, explaining what is the goal of the user study, what
are the tasks they have to fulfill and a visual tutorial of the UI.

Volunteers answer on a (query, context) pair basis, and change page between each one, so that they are not displayed
with all the rankings at once and not confused. They are, however, allowed to go back and forth in the user study in
order to edit their previous answers in case they realize they misunderstood an instruction or any other reason. Note
that, as they were not actively monitored while doing so, we cannot state whether volunteers tried to make all of their
judgments unified or not, but they were not asked anything like this so we believe they did not try to.

**One important difference** with[#tspr][] is that users are able to browse the web pages that are presented in the
results. They can click on links in order to make sure what they judge relevant or not. This is also explained in the
user study. We also decide to use only 5 queries so that volunteers take all the time they need to make thourough
choices.

#### Measures [measures]

In terms of measures, our user study features the two same measures as[#tspr][], in principle: precision and ranking
preference.

However, the ranking preference is going to be presented in percentage of users who selected a ranking versus the other
one, not in terms of "ranking preferred by majority" as the latter is not a precise measure in our opinion, although we
will also display an additional table similar to [](#tspr_eval_table) in order to ease cross-work comparisons.

The precision is calculated differently in our case. Indeed, a problem arose with the way[#tspr][] calculated their
precision (described in [][studyprotocol]): What happens if both rankings return the same sets of items, simply ranked
differently or if volunteers consider that all items are relevant? Then, with the method used by[#tspr][] there is no
possible comparison anymore. The precision would just be $1.0$ for both ranking and no conclusion could be drawn.
Looking at the preliminary results we had before launching the user study, we thought this case might well happen.
Indeed, our web crawl was quite focused and the IR engine works relatively well (while it might have not at the
time[#tspr][] was written which might explain their choice), and in addition to this, both rankings are often composed
of the same set of items, ranked differently. So the possibility that volunteers select all results is not nil, and it
is  even quite probable that they select the same results on both rankings. This would both ruin the experiment's output
information and would also be extremely tedious for the volunteers: it would mean 20 clicks for each query. This is why
volunteers are asked to only select at most 5 relevant results per ranking, for every query. This way, we are going to
define the _precision_ $p_{a}(q, u)$ for the ranking $a$ (baseline, cppr), a query $q$ and a volunteer $u$ is as
follows:

$$p_{a}(q, u) = 
\cfrac{ \sum\limits_{r \in \mathcal{R}(q, u)}{(11 - rank(r))} }{ \sum\limits_{i \in [[1, 5]]}{(11 - i)} }$$

with $\mathcal{R}(q, u)$ the set of results selected as relevant for the query $q$ by the volunteer $u$ and $rank(r)$
its rank in the ranking (1 = first (top) position, 10=last (bottom) position). Once the precisions for a given query are
computed for all volunteers, we simply take the average over the volunteers.

<!-- % Proofread once until here. -->

However, this suffers from one inherent issue: Some volunteers could have generally selected a higher number of relevant
results than others. Indeed, some volunteers could simply generally have a higher standard of "relevancy" and some
others a lower one. The global averaged precision is calculated as if everyone had the same judgments standards, which
is not necessarily true. As a consequence, we think the best comparison is the average _volunteer-specific precision
difference_ between the baseline and the CPPR rankings, for every query. The precision _difference_ is calculated by
subtracting the precision given to the _baseline_  ranking by a given volunteer on a given query, to the precision
computed for this same query and volunteer. Thus, if a volunteer generally has a higher standard of relevancy, she
should have also selected a lower number of relevant results for the  _baseline_ ranking and thus the difference should
be comparable volunteer-wide. Note that we use the _relative_ difference here. The formula is as follows:

$$pd(q, u) = \cfrac{p_{cppr}(q, u) - p_{baseline}(q, u)}{p_{baseline}(q, u)}$$

Note that $pd(q, u)$ can be negative, which would mean that the baseline was more precise than the CPPR ranking.

A second set of measures is also done as a part of the evaluation. As in the original Topic-Sensitive PageRank
paper[#tspr][] and in other research papers about PPR, we will compute the O-Similarity and the K-Similarity of the
rankings. Such measures have been widely used in the past to compare rankings, and especially personalized 
PageRank-based ones. One can find them in[#tspr][][#socialtagging][][#abelfolks][][#predictpath][].

<!-- \pagebreak -->

OSim indicates the degree of overlap between the top $n$ URLs of two rankings. Formula: 

$$OSim(r_1, r_2) = \cfrac{A \cap B}{k}$$

with $k$ the size of both sets $A$ and $B$ which respectively represent the set of URLs of
rankings $r_1$ and $r_2$

KSim, on the other hand, is the probability that two rankings agree on the relative ordering of a randomly selected pair
of distinct nodes (u,v). Formula:

$$KSim(r_1, r_2) =

with $U = A \cup B$ and $r^{\prime}_1$ is the ranking constructed by adding items in $r_2$ but not in $r_1$ at the end
of $r_1$ with their ordinal ranking from $r_2$ (that is to say, a rank equal to the sum of the highest rank in $r_1$ and
their original rank in $r_2$). $r^{\prime}_2$ is constructed the same way. This will provide information on the amount
of changes that our personalization brings to the final ranking.

#### Selected Queries [selectedqueries]

The following methodology was used to select the queries used in the user study:

1. We ran a click analysis on the queries of the logs. For each query, we calculated:

    - Its total number of clicks.
    - Its click entropy, using the click entropy formula of[#largescaleeval][].

2. We sorted the items descending order of click entropy and kept the 10,000 top ones.

3. We normalized number of clicks and click entropy values and computed the sum of their normalized values.

4. We sorted items in descending order of this sum.

5. We removed the queries with null [clustering vectors][qclusters].

6. We ran a pattern-based filter to get rid of a set of keywords and expressions not suitable for the user study (sex
and pornography related queries).

7. We kept the first 1,000 of the resulting list.

8. We then manually randomly selected queries that would be easily understood by the volunteers of the user study and
where personalization made sense (ambiguous or "general enough" queries).    

The resulting list of queries is the following (displayed in this order in the user study):

<!--  
% Note: Exceptionnally, we use LateX for this list as we want no spacing at all and thus we have to pass it as a
% parameter to the enumerate package

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item ``pizza''
\item ``massage''
\item ``water fountain''
\item ``tattoo art''
\item ``science experiments''
\end{enumerate}
-->

The corresponding users from the logs were selected by executing the `find_one()` method of MongoDB on the collection of
clicks that had been stored at an earlier stage of the work. All selected users had queried the corresponding query and
clicked at least once on one of its links, no other criteria was used.

The reason why we selected queries that way, especially the descending order sorting using the combination of clicks and 
click entropy is based on a mix of data requirements and previous works results: 

- The most clicks we had, the highest was the probability that the ["remapping" step][urlremapping] would not return an
empty set of elements (that would mean we cannot  personalize this query using our data).

- The higher the click entropy the most impact personalization can make, as a high click entropy means that different
users  do this query for different information needs, it has been experimented in[#largescaleeval][].

-->
#### Ranking Preferences [rankingprefs]

![User Study: Volunteers Ranking Preferences][ranking_prefs_diag]

[ranking_prefs_diag]: best_ranking_preference.png

[](#ranking_prefs_diag) presents the volunteers ranking preferences for each query. As we can see, for all five queries,
the majority of volunteers preferred the CPPR ranking. For two specific queries, preference towards the personalized
ranking is over 70%. Also, only one volunteer did not prefer the CPPR ranking for the first query.

As a way to ease comparison with[#tspr][], we summarize the preferences in a similar table to [](#tspr_eval_table) in
[][preferred_table_comparison].

| Query                 | Preferred By Majority (>50%) |
 ---------------------- | :--------------------------: |
| pizza                 |        CPPR                  |
| massage               |        CPPR                  |
| water fountain        |        CPPR                  |
| tattoo art            |        CPPR                  |
| science experiments   |        CPPR                  |

| Globally              |        CPPR                  |
[Preferred Ranking Table, in comparison with [](#tspr_eval_table)][preferred_table_comparison]

From preferences presented in [](#ranking_prefs_diag) and [](#tspr_eval_table), we can already say that the experiment
shows that users perceive a _measurable_ improvement thanks to the personalization. This is an encouraging result.
Indeed, the main goal of a widely-deployed end-user system such as a search engine is not only to theoretically improve
its results from a scientific point of view but also from an applied point of view to satisfy its users. 

#### Precision [precisionresults]

The average precisions of both baseline and CPPR rankings can be found in [](#avg_precisions_cppr_baseline_results) and
are in accordance with the percentages of preferences described in [](#ranking_prefs_diag) except for the third query
where, surprisingly and while a majority of users still preferred the personalized ranking, they consistently selected
relevant results that were ranked higher in the baseline in comparison with the CPPR ranking. This might mean that the
personalized ranking for this query, overall, contained more relevant elements, even if the 5 most relevant ones were
ranked lower, and volunteers globally preferred a ranking that has more relevant results even if they are not ranked
optimally. However, as they could not select more than 5 relevant results, they could not express the fact that more
relevant results were present in the personalized ranking.

![Average Precisions Of Baseline And CPPR Rankings, Per Query][avg_precisions_cppr_baseline_results]

[avg_precisions_cppr_baseline_results]: avg_precisions_cppr_baseline_results.png

<!-- \pagebreak -->

The _volunteer-wise_ relative precision difference, that is to say the relative precision difference computed on a per-
volunteer basis, is shown in [](#avg_volunteer_wide_precisions_difference_results). An issue arose when computing the
precision difference using the formula proposed in [][measures]: For the query "pizza", nearly half of the volunteers
did not select any relevant results for the baseline, effectively assigning it a nil score. But those same volunteers
did select at  least one relevant result for the personalized ranking. As a consequence, the _relative_ difference for
such volunteers  is $+\infty$, which obviously drives the _average_ over all volunteers to be $+\infty$ too. In order to
overcome this problem, we observed that in all such cases volunteers in fact simply selected no results for the baseline
and one for the personalized ranking. We considered that assigning a relative difference of 100% would be a fair
approximation. Indeed, the volunteer selection was basically a binary judgment: either this result was there, or not.
For the rest of the queries, the precision difference is pretty much following the trend of difference in average
precisions that could be observed in [](#avg_precisions_cppr_baseline_results), with a higher amplitude. This means that
volunteers globally did the user study with similar "standards of relevancy". The average of the volunteer-wise relative
precision difference is 21.60%. This is a very encouraging result as this means that globally, volunteers indeed felt a
significant improvement in the personalized ranking, compared to the baseline.

![Volunteer-Wise Relative Precision Difference From Baseline][avg_volunteer_wide_precisions_difference_results]

[avg_volunteer_wide_precisions_difference_results]: avg_volunteer_wide_precisions_difference_results.png

#### OSim and KSim

Figures [](#osim_top5_10_20_results) and [](#ksim_top5_10_20_results) present the resulting OSim and KSim measures as
defined in [][measures].

As we can see in [](#osim_top5_10_20_results), the second query has a nil OSimilarity for the top 5 results, while all
the  other queries have non-nil similarities. This is probably related to the fact that the precision of the second
query is the only one that was worse in the CPPR ranking compared to the baseline one.

The measures overall are similar to previous works using such measures, such as[#tspr][] and[#predictpath][], which
means  that our personalization algorithm performs on similar grounds compared to previously proposed ones, even though
our  experimental setup is suboptimal. This is, once more, a very encouraging result for future work in this area.

# Conclusion [conclusion]

## Conclusion

In this Master Thesis, we have developed a personalization technique to be applied to web search using the Personalized
PageRank as means of personalization. We have proposed a way to evaluate such technique using an online platform and a
user  study protocol, reusing evaluation features of previous works when it was possible and improving them where we
thought they had issues or lacked precision. We have provided all necessary details of our experimental setup such that
future works can both verify our results and compare against our implementation, that is available to all on
Internet[#githubcode][]. Results of our evaluation have showed that our approach works and has a measurable impact on
the quality of the results.

In terms of the research questions that were formulated in [][resquestions], we believed we answered the research
questions in the following ways:

1. We can use the relative number of clicks on queries from the clicks logs. This is enough to be able to build a
profile and to be integrated with an external source of semantics, provided by[#lyes][]'s results in our setup. 

2. The user profile can be constructed using the clickthrough data analysis formulas presented in [][usagemining]. Based
on the work that was done in[#largescaleeval][], and together with [our integration of semantics][qclusters], it
provides a good way to match users with  each other to allow collaborative scores to be computed for web graph nodes.
This, in return, allows personalization of the SERP through PageRank using the _personalization vector_.

3. Results show that the approach can perform well, even sometimes on a comparable scale with previous approaches
(as[#tspr][] and[#largescaleeval][]) even when the setup is not optimal.

4. We have proposed a rigorous user study protocol, as described in [][studyprotocol], to evaluate web search
personalization  in the case of search results re-ranking through PageRank.

There still is room for improvement in many different parts of our approach though. As such, we will discuss in the
next section the details of the improvements that we believe can be performed and the future work that can be done
related to this technique.


## Future Work [futurework]

### User profiling & Usage Mining

The user profiling method we use in our work is based mainly on previous simple user profile representations such
as[#largescaleeval][]. However, it has been proven that using multiple features, instead of basing the personalizationg
on a  unique feature (in our case, a semantic-aware clicks-based profile), can greatly improve the performance of the
personalization system. In particular,[#longshortclicks][] presents a unified framework for web search personalization
and  proposes an already quite complete list of personalization features that can be extracted from search engines
clicks logs.

[#longshortclicks][] and[#eexcess][] also use a technique of "temporal decrease" of the importance of the
personalization information. The older the information, the less importance it is given. This comes from the fact that
the user is likely to have interests closer to what she was doing 5 minutes ago compared to what she did a month ago.
However, long-term  profiles are also useful especially in collaborative systems as their permit to match users together
on a "similar minds"  measure basis. Thus, it seems important to use both long-term and short-term information in order
to provide with different  personalization features that would help both personalized effectively and match users
effectively.[#longshortclicks][] shows that a combination of short and long-term information outperforms in all cases
using only one, the other or using them  without differentiating them. In the case of our technique, one could for
instance  use the long-term profile of the user in order to match her with similarly minded people. But once the
matching would be  done, we could either restrict the information used to constitute the web graph node personalization
score to short-term  information or use both short-term and long-term information with different weights.

An interesting approach to be studied in future work would be to use an adaptive personalization algorithm. Such an
adaptive  technique could look for short-term information, evaluate the level of personalization it would provide and,
depending on  the result, choose to use the long-term information too or restrict the personalization to scores based on
short-term information. The same technique can be imagined for the matching too. We could even go one step further  and
simply constitute two profiles for every user: a long-term and short-term one. When the personalization system is run,
depending on the quality of using one profile against the other, it dynamically chooses a profile. This would be, in
some  ways, a sort of combination of ideas presented in[#longshortclicks][] (short/long-term profiles) and[#bollacker][]
(use of  multiple profiles).

Another important feature that is not taken into account in our usage mining is the _dwell time_ related to each click
of the search engine logs. The _dwell time_ is the estimated time that the user has spent on the page she has clicked.
This  time can be estimated using the other actions of the user with the search engine.[#dwelltimes][] and[#yandex][]
have shown  that the dwell time is an important measure and allows to improve the recommendation/personalization
performance.

### CPPR Computation Scaling

A criticism that can be done to our experimental setup and more widely to our technique is that it is very expensive in
terms of computation, thus making it not suitable to be deployed on a large scale.

The approach is indeed very expensive in _our_ experimental setup. However, a great amount of work has been done on
optimizing personalized PageRank computation in the past. Among the promising ones,[#partialpr][], but
also[#effcomputepr][] and[#blockpr][] allow to speed up significantly the computation of the Personalized PageRank. In
particular,[#partialpr][] presents a technique where a part of the PageRank vectors is only computed once and only the
rest  of the computation has to be run again in order to update the PageRank.

Moreover, adaptation of the PageRank algorithm to be run on the Google MapReduce system are available on the
Internet[^mrpagerank]. A large scale system would mean that we also have access to larger scale computation networks.
By combining the previously stated optimizations of PPR computation in addition to distributed computation techniques,
we believe one can achieve CPPR computation on larger scales with an interesting ratio of effort/output. It is also to
be considered that we ran the  PageRank computation with a very high precision. It may not be necessary at all to have
such a precision in the case of the  CPPR ranking. Future work could especially study where precision parameter gives
the best ratio in terms of needed resources  compared to the outputted personalized ranks. It is not always necessary to
have big difference in scoring in order to  differentiate items, thus, finding the exact threshold at which we have
enough differences to be able to make good  recommendations, while still having a very low performance demand is an
important step in the deployment of such a system in production and could be a future work on this technique.

### Collaborative CPPR (CCPPR) [ccppr_futurework]

In [][cppr_vect] we talk about the possibility of a two-level collaboration for the technique that we use. Two-level
collaboration could probably yield interesting results but has the drawback of being heavier in terms of
resources. Indeed, instead of computing one CPPR vector per user and query, one needs to compute $n$ CPPR vectors with
$n$ the number of similar users to  the current user. It would nevertheless be interesting to evaluate such a technique
and especially to compare its results to  the standard CPPR one.

In relation with the idea of having multiple profiles that we have suggested in the previous section, CCPPR could be a
way to achieve this. One could imagine having several restricted-size sets of similar users, with a set being emphasized
on a  semantic category more than others and using a combination of CPPR using this limited number of users. One could
also use  this technique in order to bring _diversity_ to the results by injecting users that are less similar but have
for instance been proven to be experts in the domain and thus whose clicks provide higher relevancy to the current query.

Finally, one last application could be to select the set of CPPR vectors that we combine into a CCPPR vector not from
the  user profile but from a query profile, thus making the CCPPR vector query specific and not user specific anymore,
in  order, for instance, to globally improve the search results for users that do not have any profile yet.
